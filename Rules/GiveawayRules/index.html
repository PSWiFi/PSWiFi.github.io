<strong>So you are looking to host or join giveaways? Look no further!</strong> This page contains information about our Giveaway Guidelines. Here you will learn about the Giveaway Rules, and we will guide you on how to host a Giveaway in the room! <u>Be sure to read the entire page before attempting to participate in Giveaways</u>, PM a member of Room Staff if you have any questions.<br /> <br />

<strong>We currently support Official Giveaways in the following Pokemon titles:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li><p style="color:blue"><strong>Sword & Shield - Indicated by the BLUE background</strong></li>
<li><p style="color:purple"><strong>Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl - Indicated by the PURPLE background</strong></li>
</ul> 

<strong>We do not support Official Giveaways in previous generations and currently do not support Giveaways from Legends: Arceus or Pokemon HOME.</strong><br /><br />

<h4><strong>What are Giveaways?</strong></h4>
Giveaways are a way for users in Wi-Fi to give Pokemon back to the community on Sword/Shield or Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. We have two types of Giveaways, Lotto and Question.<br /><br />

<strong>Lotto Giveaways</strong> are luck based, click join and hope for the best.<br />

<strong>Question Giveaways</strong> are skill based, test your Pokemon knowledge and win some amazing prizes!<br /><br />

Pokemon in our giveaways are usually considered high value or high quality, if you are a collector we advise you turn on Giveaway notifications so you don't miss any. This can be done by typing /rfaq GA into Wi-Fi chat, and clicking the "Notify" button! This will ensure you are pinged as and when new Giveaways occur.<br /><br />

Remember that all giveaways hosted by users in the room are done through acts of kindness and are generally unscheduled, so please do not ask questions regarding when the next giveaway will be, and avoid complaining if you don’t manage to win a desirable giveaway.<br /><br />

<h4><strong>Which Pokemon can be given away?</strong></h4>
Your Pokemon must meet the following minimum requirement to be Given away through our room plugin:<br />
<ul>
<li>Shiny Pokemon of any kind</li>
<li>Event Pokemon of any kind</li>
<li>Pokemon with transfer exclusive movesets</li>
<li>Non-shiny flawless Pokemon</li>
<li>Non-shiny battle ready Pokemon - (Hypertraining is permitted)</li>
</ul>

In <strong>Sword/Shield and Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl</strong>, flawed Breedjects can be given away unofficially. (Example: Mudkip, Adamant, 31/x/31/31/31/31)<br />
In <strong>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</strong>, Non-shiny Pokemon can be given away unofficially. (Example: Random catch Alpha Spiritomb with 3 perfect IVs)<br />
Physical event distribution codes are also permitted to be given away unofficially.<br /><br />

An unofficial giveaway means you can simply ask users in the chat to PM you to recieve a Pokemon of your choice, these do not need to go through our Giveaway Form.<br /><br />

The following Pokemon <u>cannot be given away</u>:<br />
<ul>
<li>Anything not listed above</li>
<li>Hacked or illegal Pokemon</li>
<li>Non-Self obtained Pokemon</li>
<li>Non-shiny flawless Pokemon</li>
<li>Non-shiny battle ready Pokemon - (Hypertraining is permitted)</li>
</ul>
We have a special protocol for those who wish to Giveaway hacked/genned Pokemon, be sure to PM a member of /roomstaff and let us know your intentions.<br /><br />

<h5><u>Hosting Rules:</u></h5>
<ol>
<li>You may only give away legitimate, trade-legal Pokemon that can be traded in the Wi-Fi room according to the Room Rules.</li>
<li>You may only give away self-obtained Pokemon.</li>
<li>You must provide all the required proof in the “Additional Information” box if your Pokemon would need proof to trade, as per the Proof Rules.
</li>
<li>Your trainer name (IGN) must not reference anything of an inappropriate or offensive nature.</li>
<li>The “Additional Information” box must be kept relevant to the extra details of your Pokemon.</li>
<li>Pokemon in eggs cannot be given away.</li>
<li>Held items are considered an extra, and not the main prize. If your giveaway is advertised as holding an item you must ensure this item is attached to the Pokemon on trading with the winner.</li>
<li>Question giveaways must be Pokemon related and the answer should be locatable by a Google search. You must also provide the source to a staff member. Answers must be clear.</li>
<li><strong>See if your account meets the eligibility requirements directly below this text.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h5><u>Hosting Elegibility:</u></h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your account must be autoconfirmed on the site.</strong> This is achieved by having an account registered for over a week and winning a rated battle.</li>
<li><strong>You must promptly give the prize to the winner. (Within 30 minutes)</strong> For this reason have plenty of time to spare before hosting one.</li>
<li><strong>Only generally well behaved members of the community can host giveaways.</strong> Poorly behaved users, particularly those with involved with hacked Pokemon and scams cannot host Giveaways. This also extends to major behavioural issues at Staff discretion.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot host Giveaways if you have an existing Giveaway ban for breaking the rules.</strong> These last for a whole week.</li>
</ul>

<h5><u>Participation Elegibility:</u></h5>
If you're simply looking for information about how you can participate in Giveaways you're in the right place:
<ul>
<li><strong>Your account must be autoconfirmed on the site.</strong> This is achieved by having an account registered for over a week and winning a rated battle.</li>
<li><strong>Do not double dip Giveaways.</strong> Do not join a Giveaway of a Pokemon you have already won unless otherwise stated by the Giveaway host.</li>
<li><strong>Do not make negative comments.</strong> This is unwanted and will result in a swift Giveaway ban.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot join a Giveaway if you have an outstanding room punishment.</strong></li>
</ul>
