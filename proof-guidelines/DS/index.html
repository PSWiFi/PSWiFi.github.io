</div>

<hr />

This page contains information and examples for how to create proof for your Pokémon in <span class="fw-bold">Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, HeartGold/SoulSilver and Black(2)/White(2)</span> to an acceptable standard for general trading in PS! Wi-Fi.
<br /> <br />

<p style="color:red"><span class="fw-bold"><u>In all cases, your PS! Username should be visible somewhere within your proof link.</u> Furthermore, <u>ALL</u> Pokémon must follow the room's requirements for every generation, even if not specifically outlined here. Be sure to review <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/proof-guidelines/min-requirement/">our overall requirements</a> to see if your Pokémon meets the general standard.</span></p>

<p>As an example, although not directly described on this page, a wild shiny Pokémon with 3 IVs from an encounter with 0 guaranteed IVs will still need proof because this is a requirement for all generations, as described in our overall proofing rules found above.</p>

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Minimum Proof Requirements:</span></h4>
The following Pokémon/Encounter types need proof when obtained in <span class="fw-bold">ANY Generation 4/5 game:</span></br>

    <ul>
