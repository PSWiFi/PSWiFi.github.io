<hr />

This page contains information and examples for how to create proof for your Pokémon in the <span class="fw-bold">Red/Blue/Green/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal Virtual Console titles</span> to an acceptable standard for general trading in PS! Wi-Fi.
<br /> <br />

<p style="color:red"><span class="fw-bold"><u>In all cases, your PS! Username should be visible somewhere within your proof link.</u> Furthermore, <u>ALL</u> Pokémon must follow the room's requirements for every generation, even if not specifically outlined here. Be sure to review <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/proof-guidelines/min-requirement/">our overall requirements</a> to see if your Pokémon meets the general standard.</span></p>

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Minimum Proof Requirement:</span></h4>

The following Pokémon/Encounter types need proof when obtained in <span class="fw-bold">ANY Virtual Console game:</span><br />
<ul>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Shiny Pokémon from all types of encounters.</span></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">6 IV Pokémon from all types of encounters.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="fw-bold">All Types Of Encounters</span></h4>

<u>You must provide:</u><br />
<ul>
  <li>[Wild Encounter] A picture during an encounter with the Pokémon during the “Player threw the ball” OR “Pokémon Appeared” text box, with a paper slip showing your PS! Username.</li>
  <li>[Egg / Gift Encounter] A picture during the egg hatch/gift redemption screen with a paper slip showing your PS! Username.</li>
  <li>A picture of the Pokémon summary, clearly showing your OT/TID if not otherwise shown.</li>
  <li>If the Pokémon was RNG abused with PokéTransporter, show screenshots of the RNG tool and pcalc overlay used in order to verify this.</li>
  <li>If the Pokémon is a shiny from Gen 1, show it in the PokéTransporter box waiting to be picked up.</li>
  <li>If your Pokémon was obtained by use of an emulator, you may watermark your images instead of providing a picture with a paper slip.</li>
</ul>
