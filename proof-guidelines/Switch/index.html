<div class="text-dark container" style="max-width: 700px;">

  <!-- Text within the page.-->

  This page contains information and examples for how to create proof for your Pokémon in <span class="fw-bold">Let's Go, Sword/Shield, Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, and Legends: Arceus</span> to an acceptable standard for general trading in PS!
  Wi-Fi. <br /> <br />

  <p style="color:red"><span class="fw-bold"><u>In all cases your PS! Username should be visible somewhere within your proof link.
    </span></u></p>

  <span class="fw-bold">It is advised to unlock the IV judge function before attempting to prove a Pokémon.</span><br /> <br />

  If you cannot provide the IV judge evaluation you must find an alternative way to prove the IVs of your Pokémon, such as Teambuilder or other stat calculators.<br /><br />

  In Legends: Arceus you must show off the effort levels of your Pokémon immediately after the initial encounter instead of an IV judge evaluation.<br /><br />

  <u>When a Pokémon is sent to boxes:</u><br />
  <ul>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Sword/Shield</span> it will go to the first available box slot in the box you last viewed.</li>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl</span> it will go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Legends: Arceus</span> it will also go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Let's Go</span> it will also go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
  </ul>

  In <span class="fw-bold">Sword/Shield and Legends: Arceus</span>, Overworld spawns will be the same until you leave the area, this means you can save and retry if you make a mistake. <br /><br />

  <h4><span class="fw-bold">Sword & Shield Proofing:</span></h4>

  <h6><span class="fw-bold">Max Raid Battles & Dynamax Adventure:</span></h6>
  <ul>
    <li><u>You must provide a consistent video of a successful capture leading into in-box IV evaluation and summary screens, enough to clearly show OT/TID and nature. The video should start on or before the raid reward screen.</u></li>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">If your raid was obtained using raid RNG,</span> you must provide a screenshot of the tool used displaying your seed, frame count, IVs, PID and EC. It is encouraged to partially blur the seed, PID and EC. </li>
  </ul>

    <li><span class="fw-bold">Eternatus is a unique case and an exception,</span> your video portion can start from any portion of the cutscene and most provide all above information. It is impossible to have the IV judge evaluation so you may prove
      the IVs using a Teambuilder screenshot or similar.</li>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Pokémon obtained from brilliant aura and chain fishing</span> have a higher chance to have multiple perfect IVs, so be prepared to make proof for these Pokémon properly as and when they appear.</li>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Wild shiny Pokemon with a Rare Mark</span> can appear at any time! Be sure to check the Ribbon summary of any shiny you catch!</li>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Rare 1% Wild Encounter Shinies</span> can appear at any time! So be prepared to make proof for these Pokémon properly as and when they appear.</li>

  <ul>
    <li><u>You must provide a video of the initial encounter, clearly showing that you have encountered a shiny variant in the overworld.</u></li>
    <li><u>You must provide a consistent video of a successful capture or redemption leading into in-box IV evaluation and summary screens, enough to clearly show OT/TID and nature.</u></li>

  <h4><span class="fw-bold">Legends: Arceus Proofing:</span></h4>

  <h6><span class="fw-bold">Overworld, Legendary & Mythical Encounters:</span></h6>
  <ul>
    <li>You must provide a consistent video of a successful capture or redemption leading into in-box Effort Level evaluation and summary screens, enough to clearly show OT/TID and nature.</li>
    <li>Your Pokémon must be sent to the party. Ensure you have a slot available for it to go to.</li>
    <li>If your Pokémon was achieved by RNG abuse, you can include screenshots of tools used to further prove IVs. You may also use overlays such as capturesight accompanied with a proof video to prove the IVs.</li>
  </ul>

  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/">Legends: Arceus Example</a><br /><br />

  You can turn off autosave to re-encounter most Pokémon in the overworld. You can use this to your advantage and save upon encountering any Pokémon you believe may need proof, and you can then adjust your party accordingly.<br /><br />

  Due to the complex Effort Level system, <u>only full 31 IVs will be considered towards the total IV count proof barrier.</u> This will be able to be displayed after initial capture as an initial effort level of 3 indicates a perfect IV of 31 in the
  stat.<br /><br />
