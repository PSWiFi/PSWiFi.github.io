</div>

<hr />

<div class="text-dark container" style="max-width: 700px;">

  This page contains information and examples for how to create proof for your Pokémon in <span class="fw-bold">Sword/Shield, Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee & Legends: Arceus</span> to an acceptable standard for general trading in PS!
  Wi-Fi. <br /> <br />

<p style="color:red"><span class="fw-bold"><u>In all cases, your PS! Username should be visible somewhere within your proof link.</u> Furthermore, <u>ALL</u> Pokémon must follow the room's requirements for every generation, even if not specifically outlined here. Be sure to review <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/proof-guidelines/min-requirement/">our overall requirements</a> to see if your Pokémon meets the general standard.</span></p>

<p>As an example, although not directly described on this page, a stationary Pokémon with 6 IVs from an encounter with 3 guaranteed IVs will still need proof because this is a requirement for all generations, as described in our overall proofing rules found above.</p>

  <span class="fw-bold">It is advised to unlock the IV judge function before attempting to prove a Pokémon.</span><br /> <br />

  If you cannot provide the IV judge evaluation you must find an alternative way to prove the IVs of your Pokémon, such as Teambuilder or other stat calculators.<br /><br />

  In Legends: Arceus you must show off the effort levels of your Pokémon immediately after the initial encounter instead of an IV judge evaluation.<br /><br />

  <u>When a Pokémon is sent to boxes:</u><br />
  <ul>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Sword/Shield</span> it will go to the first available box slot in the box you last viewed.</li>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl</span> it will go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Legends: Arceus</span> it will also go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
    <li>In <span class="fw-bold">Let's Go</span> it will also go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
  </ul>

  In <span class="fw-bold">Sword/Shield and Legends: Arceus</span>, Overworld spawns will be the same until you leave the area, this means you can save and retry if you make a mistake. <br /><br />

  </ul>

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Legends: Arceus Proofing:</span></h4>

    <li>Disable autosave to re-encounter most Pokémon in the overworld. Use this to your advantage and save upon encountering any Pokémon you believe may need proof, and you can then adjust your party accordingly.</li>
