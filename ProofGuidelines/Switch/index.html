    <!-- Text within the page.-->

This page contains information and examples for how to create proof for your Pokémon in <strong>Let's Go, Sword/Shield, Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, and Legends: Arceus</strong> to an acceptable standard for general trading in PS! Wi-Fi. <br /> <br />

<p style="color:red"><strong><u>In all cases your PS! Username should be visible somewhere within your proof link.
</strong></u></p>

<strong>It is advised to unlock the IV judge function before attempting to prove a Pokémon.</strong><br /> <br />

If you cannot provide the IV judge evaluation you must find an alternative way to prove the IVs of your Pokémon, such as Teambuilder or other stat calculators.<br /><br />

In Legends: Arceus you must show off the effort levels of your Pokémon immediately after the initial encounter instead of an IV judge evaluation.<br /><br />

<u>When a Pokémon is sent to boxes:</u><br />
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Sword/Shield</strong> it will go to the first available box slot in the box you last viewed.</li>
<li>In <strong>Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl</strong> it will go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
<li>In <strong>Legends: Arceus</strong> it will also go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
<li>In <strong>Let's Go</strong> it will also go into the first available box slot starting from box 1.</li>
</ul>

In <strong>Sword/Shield and Legends: Arceus</strong>, Overworld spawns will be the same until you leave the area, this means you can save and retry if you make a mistake. <br /><br />

<h4><strong>Sword & Shield Proofing:</strong></h4>

<h6><strong>Max Raid Battles & Dynamax Adventure:</strong></h6>
<ul>
<li><u>You must provide a consistent video of a successful capture leading into in-box IV evaluation and summary screens, enough to clearly show OT/TID and nature. The video should start on or before the raid reward screen.</u></li>
<li><strong>If your raid was obtained using raid RNG,</strong> you must provide a screenshot of the tool used displaying your seed, frame count, IVs, PID and EC. It is encouraged to partially blur the seed, PID and EC. </li>
</ul><br />

<ul>

<li><strong>Eternatus is a unique case and an exception,</strong> your video portion can start from any portion of the cutscene and most provide all above information. It is impossible to have the IV judge evaluation so you may prove the IVs using a Teambuilder screenshot or similar.</li>
<li><strong>Pokémon obtained from brilliant aura and chain fishing</strong> have a higher chance to have multiple perfect IVs, so be prepared to make proof for these Pokémon properly as and when they appear.</li>
<li><strong>Wild shiny Pokemon with a Rare Mark</strong> can appear at any time! Be sure to check the Ribbon summary of any shiny you catch!</li>

<li><strong>All pictures require a paper slip on display clearly showing your PS! Username.</strong></li>
</ul><br />

<h6><strong>Wild Sinistea-Antique:</strong></h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>You must show a video in-battle clearly showing the blue Antique mark of your Sinistea.</strong></li>
<li><u>You must also provide a consistent video of a successful capture leading into the in-box IV evaluation and summary screens, clearly showing the OT/TID and nature, Sinistea MUST go to party.</u></li>
