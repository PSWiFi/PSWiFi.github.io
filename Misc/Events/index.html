<strong>Curious about our event sections? Great! We are always looking for committed helpers to our event sections.</strong> This page contains a brief overview on what being an Event Helper entails. <br /> <br />

Being an Event Helper allows you to get behind the scenes of how our events work and be actively involved in them. You will be a part of a huge, supportive team that will be able to assist you and work alongside you. Event Helpers further define the vision for our room of Wi-Fi: a fun place for everyone to come and play Pokémon. <br /><br />

You will only be able to help with a maximum of 2 event archetypes at any given time, we will not allow you to do more than this as you simply won’t have enough time. Also, understand that helping out as an Event Helper is a commitment. Please consider if you think you would have the time to help out. If you have any more questions, please ask the leaders of each event archetype - they’re listed at the top of each description of their archetype. We hope to have you on our team!<br /><br />

We have 4 (four!) helper sections that you can apply for, Small Events, Tournaments, Prizes and Giveaways, each section will be covered individually down below.<br /><br />

<strong>We encourage you apply for any section you take an interest in!</strong><br /><br />

   <h4><strong>Small Events:</strong></h4>
   <strong>Current Leaders:</strong> Argynt & Nicolic! <br /><br />
   Becoming a Wi-Fi Small Events Helper allows you to use your creativity to host your own fun event ideas! It’s a flexible role where the greatest strength is one’s own imagination, with the events ranging from small tournaments to large scale competitions. If you choose this role, you’re expected to run or help with a small event once every three months, which allows you to participate in a way that suits your schedule. If you have a great idea and don’t know how to approach it, other members of the small events team can help with that too!<br /><br />
   
   There are many types of events that you can get involved in! Here are a few examples of events hosted by us in the past:

   <ul>
   <li>Hangman tournaments</li>
   <li>QR Team - Battle event</li>
   <li>The Hatching Contest</li>
   <li>Ribbon Master events</li>
   <li>Pokémon camping events</li>
   <li>Trivia</li>
   <li>And many more!</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h4><strong>Tournaments:</strong></h4>
   <strong>Current Leaders:</strong> Loethalion & Sir Lora! <br /><br />
   Being a Wi-Fi Tour Helper requires a moderate amount of commitment, however, it is a way to give back to the people who run your current Tour Events! If you choose to go down the path of many Wi-Fi event helpers, you will also get a say in what events we host, and you may be able to create your own events if approved! <br /><br />

Besides helping out at the large tournament that happens at the end of every month, what do Tour Helpers do? Plenty!<br /><br />

   <h5><strong>Nugget Bridge Helper:</strong></h5>
   Nugget Bridge Helpers verify wins/losses through images submitted by players, and direct users on issues that might occur during a battle (E.G. disconnection, trouble reporting, timer decisions).<br /><br />

   <h5><strong>Competative Pokémon Obtainer:</strong></h5>
   Competitive Pokémon Obtainers may need to breed, receive events, and catch certain Pokemon we need for the metagame. Once these Pokémon are obtained, they must be trained to be fully battle-ready and given to a Tour Leader.<br /><br />

   <h5><strong>Sim Tour Helper:</strong></h5>
   The easiest role in tours - a Sim Tour Helpers fosters discussion about that month’s tier and then types .tour leaderboard into the chat to let users practice battling in that tier on Showdown. Sim Tour Helpers are expected to hype up and supervise their tournament.<br /><br />
   
   <h5><strong>Switch Tour Helper:</strong></h5>
   Possibly the hardest role in tours, however a role which has some room for your creativity - Switch Tour Helpers run our in game practice tours at times which they can choose. This also means handling forms and documents related to running the tournament.<br /><br />
   
      <h4><strong>Giveaways:</strong></h4>
   <strong>Current Leaders:</strong> Billo, Shahafs & WigglyTree! <br /><br />
   Wi-Fi Giveaway Helpers are the ones in charge of Wi-Fi’s popular official giveaways! This role is a commitment to helping at least once every 3 months with official giveaways, and allows you to have a say in what Pokémon you would like to see given away. What do Giveaway Helpers do? Again, plenty!<br /><br />

<h5><strong>Theme Suggestions:</strong></h5>
At the start of a giveaway cycle, all helpers are welcome to suggest a theme and a set of Pokémon to go with it. After a period of a few days, themes will be voted on to decide the official theme of that giveaway.<br /><br />

<h5><strong>Pokémon Obtainment:</strong></h5>
Pokémon for giveaways are obtained entirely within the GA Team. Giveaway Obtainers are responsible for helping to obtain and train rare Pokémon to be given away.<br /><br />

<h5><strong>Pokémon Distribution:</strong></h5>
On the day of an official giveaway, Giveaway Distributors will sign up for time slots in which to hold lottery giveaways. These giveaways will be recorded on the same spreadsheet as time slots.<br /><br />
   
   <h4><strong>Prizes:</strong></h4>
   <strong>Current Leaders:</strong> Nol, Laguna & SexyMalasada! <br /><br />
   The Wi-Fi Prizes Team is the lifeblood of Wi-Fi events. Made up of individuals who work to provide Pokemon for the Wi-FI WP Shop, this team serves the important role of making sure there is a wide variety of prizes for event participants.<br /><br />

Helpers will earn WP valuing at one-fifth of each contribution. (i.e. donating a 100 WP prize will earn the donator 20 WP.)<br /><br />
