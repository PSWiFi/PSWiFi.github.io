        <span class="fw-bold">1. You must provide any information about a Pok&eacute;mon if asked by a member of Staff.</span>

        <p>In the event a member of <code class="fw-bold">/roomstaff</code> contacts you in regards to a room trade, you are obligated to provide the information requested.</p>

        <p>In order to properly investigate trade negotiations, we require all trade deals that were initiated on site to be completed on site. Taking trades to other platforms is unsafe and may result in scams.</p>

        <p>You may face punishment if you do not provide information to a staff member when requested, or attempt to circumvent any of the trade rules in any way.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Proof is a concept that helps in verifying the legitimacy of high value Pok&eacute;mon. When negotiating a trade the proof should come from the person trading the Pok&eacute;mon, not the original obtainer of the Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

        <p>We recommend saving proof links that you recieve in trades if you wish to trade the Pok&eacute;mon further. The trader and/or original obtainer are not obligated to send proof links again if you did not save them during the original transaction.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Regarding Codes:</span></h6>
        <p>Event distribution codes can be given away for free on a first-come-first-served basis. You may also ask members of the community to redeem codes on your behalf, but be cautious of the potential scam risk involved in doing so.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Regarding Services:</span></h6>
        <p>Players may offer services (train, evolve, apply ribbons etc.) for other members of the community. The player offering the service must agree on an expected timeframe that the deal will be completed. Staff members will intervene if a deal is left incomplete <u>after 24 hours have passed</u>.</p>

        <p>For services where a reward is offered or evolution help, ensure that you have the reward/resources available to complete the deal promptly. Try to keep your trade partner regularly informed about the progress of the transaction.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Regarding Cloning:</span></h6>
        <p>Cloning is considered a service, the only users that are permitted to clone Pokemon for others are the members of the <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/misc/cloning/" target="_blank">approved cloners team</a>. You may face punishment if you are found to be offering cloning services and are not on the list.</p>

        <p>These types of trades are not strictly banned but are considered to be a scam risk. Be aware of the risk involved with accepting these types of deals and consider using a middleman if you have concerns.</p>

        <p>You can request for a trusted user to middleman your trade either in private messages or in the main room, trusted users are ranked Voice (+) or above (% @ #).</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">HOME Trades:</span></h6>
        <p>Trading within Pok&eacute;mon HOME is supported by for <u>Friend Trades only</u>! Though it is still recommended to trade within official main series games where possible. Pok&eacute;mon obtained from GTS/WT/Group Trades are not allowed to be traded under any circumstances.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Event Injection:</span></h6>

        <p>Wonder Card injections for event distributions is permitted under strict conditions. You must be absolutely certain to inject the correct card depending on your game, console, region and system time. If injected correctly this is considered to be the same as recieving a gift legltimately.</p>

        <p>Mystery Gift injection of items or toggling event flags for Pok&eacute;mon encounters (e.g BDSP Mythicals & Gen 3 event island encounters) is permitted as the encounter is still generated as intended by the game.</p>

        <h6><span class="fw-bold">Unofficial Servers:</span></h6>

        <p>Unofficial servers may be used to obtain certain things like otherwise unobtainable Ribbons in past generations where online services have been terminated, such as the World Ability Ribbon in DS games.</p>

        <p>Using these servers to obtain Pok&eacute;mon (such as Events, GTS, etc) is still strictly banned and Pok&eacute;mon obtained using this method that wind up displaying as illegal will result in punishment falling on the head of the obtainer.</p>

    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Save restores are permitted under the condition that it does not produce an illegal result, such as save restoring over a story altering choice or recapturing legendaries in games where TID/SID RNG abuse is not possible (SwSh | PLA | SV).</p>

        <p>In games where TID/SID RNG abuse is possible (BDSP | Gen 7 or earlier), you may use save restoration to capture the same legendary more than once or for a story altering choice.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Example of permitted use:</span> Using a save restore to catch a legendary more than once in GBA games.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Example of banned use:</span> Using save restores to capture Regidrago when Regieleki has already been caught on the same save file.</p>

        <p>Abusing save restoration to re-use egg seeds in 3DS games is disallowed, and will be treated the same way as seed injection. However, re-using initial seeds on GBA/DS/3DS games for other encounter types is permitted.</p>

        <p>RNG abuse is permitted due to the Pok&eacute;mon being generated and spawned by the game. RNG abuse in a nutshell is using knowledge of how the game generates Pok&eacute;mon to your advantage in order to achieve a desirable result.</p>

        <p>Cute Charm RNG abuse in past generation games is permitted as this takes advantage of standard TID/SID RNG abuse to achieve a result.</p>

        <p>Botting or automation is also permitted, this uses an automated routine in order to force a specific encounter, such as a Shiny Pokemon. Generally speaking automating encounters is no different from playing the game as intended.</p>
