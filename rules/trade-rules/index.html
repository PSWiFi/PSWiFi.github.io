<hr />

This page contains important information about the trade rules. Read through all of the information carefully if you plan to participate in trading in the room.
<br />
<br />
We facilitate trading in all main series Pok&eacute;mon games that are currently supported by official Nintendo Online services. <u>This includes all 3DS and Switch titles.</u>
<br />
<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Reminder:</span> <span class="fw-bold warn">TRADING HACKED OR ILLEGAL POKEMON IS STRICTLY BANNED.</span>
<br />

  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="TradeRule1">1. You must provide any information about a Pok&eacute;mon if asked by a member of Staff.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>In the event a member of <code>/roomstaff</code> contacts you in regards to a room trade, you are obligated to provide the information requested.</p>
  </div>

<br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="TradeRule2">2. You must be able to provide proof for all transactions if proof is required.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>See the <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/proof-guidelines/min-requirement/">Proofing Requirements</a> page for more information about the types of Pok&eacute;mon that need proof to trade. Proofing is generally reserved for high value
      Pok&eacute;mon to help certify legitimacy.</p>

    <p>Proof should come from the person trading the high value Pok&eacute;mon. The original owner of the Pok&eacute;mon is not obligated to provide the proofing on request.</p>

    <p>It is recommended to save proof links you receive from trades in the room if you wish to further trade the Pok&eacute;mon around. Avoid asking for proof links you did not save.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="TradeRule3">3. You may only trade in-game Pok&eacute;mon, items, or services.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Trading Pok&eacute;mon for money, possessions, or event distribution codes is banned. This is to prevent risk of scams.</p>

    <p>Event distribution codes can be given away for free if you wish on a first-come-first-served basis. You may also ask users to redeem event codes on your behalf, but be cautious of the potential scam risk involved in doing so.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="TradeRule4">4. Limit your trade posts to a singular message.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Once you have found a trade partner you can take the trade discussion to private messages. Try to keep trade posts once per 20 lines to reduce clutter.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Use tags such as [Gen 6] [Gen 7] [LGPE] [SwSh] [BDSP] [PLA]. We also recommend using a LF (Looking For) and (For Trade) format when making a trade post.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> LF: Hidden Ability Bulbasaur / FT: Hidden Ability Charmander or Squirtle [SWSH]</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>This is to prevent risk of scams, multiple-for-one trades are not strictly banned, but be aware of the scam risk involved with accepting these types of trade deals.</p>

    <p>Trading within Pok&eacute;mon HOME is unsupported by PS! Wi-Fi, do so at your own risk. It's recommended to trade within official main series games where possible.</p>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="TradeRule7">7. WC injections and save restores are permitted if performed correctly.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Wonder Card injection is permitted under strict conditions, you must inject the card properly and be absolutely certain of this. You will be held responsible for illegal Pok&eacute;mon as a result of an incorrectly injected Wonder Card.</p>

    <p>If the Wonder Card is injected properly this is considered okay by PS! Wi-Fi trading standard, as the end result is no different to having legitimately obtained the event distribution from a code or location.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Save restores are permitted under the condition that it does not produce an illegal result, such as save restoring over a story altering choice.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Example of permitted use:</span> Using a save restore to catch a legendary more than once.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Example of banned use:</span> Using save restores to capture Regidrago when Regieleki has already been caught on the same save file.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Do not attempt to control what a user does with a Pok&eacute;mon you have traded to them. It is their Pok&eacute;mon now and the Pok&eacute;mon you traded for is yours.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Can I trade this Pok&eacute;mon?</h1>
</div>
<hr />

Whether you can trade a Pok&eacute;mon or not depends on how the Pok&eacute;mon was obtained, and how it ended up in your hands. Find the situation that best applies to you in the list below:<br /><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="SelfObtained">I caught, claimed or hatched it myself. &#9989;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Pok&eacute;mon obtained through regular gameplay on an official, unmodified game can be traded in the room. Be sure to check the Proof Guidelines to see if it needs proof.</p>

    <p>RNG abuse is also permitted as this simply takes advantage of understanding how the game generates the details of the Pok&eacute;mon in order to achieve a desirable result.</p>

    <p>Cloning is also permitted if done properly, properly cloned Pok&eacute;mon are no different to the original entity.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="ObtainedInTrade">Someone traded it to me/I won a Giveaway in the Wi-Fi room, it came with proof. &#9989;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Chances are this Pok&eacute;mon can be traded, contact a member of Room Staff if you are uncertain/suspicious about a Pok&eacute;mon you have received in room trades or giveaways.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="LinkTradeEgg">It is (or was hatched from) a flawless shiny egg from a Link Trade in Gen 8. &#128528;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>You may NOT trade this Pok&eacute;mon in the room. Flawless shiny Pok&eacute;mon originating from Link Trades are a large source of hacks. As a result there is a blanket ban on all flawless shiny eggs obtained in link trades in Generation 8.
    </p>

    <p>If your egg is self-obtained, then make sure to hatch the Pok&eacute;mon inside before trading it around.</p>

    <p>This rule also extends to flawless (6IV) Manaphy in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold" id="RareGen3">It is a rare event from Gen 3. &#128528;</span>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The only event Pok&eacute;mon from generation 3 that can be traded are those that come from items, such as Old Sea Map Mew and Pok&eacute;mon encountered from boat tickets. Otherwise, these Pok&eacute;mon cannot be traded in the room.</p>
  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Altering the length of chains is permitted as long as this does not alter the generation of Pok&eacute;mon in any way. If your chain was achieved naturally or via RNG abuse, this rule does not apply to your Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

    <p>If you have altered the chain length to achieve a result, this should be noted during the trade to make sure the receiver is aware. This can be noted in private messages, on trade sheets, or in Giveaway forms.</p>

      <li>“Menu glitches” in Brilliant Diamond &amp; Shining Pearl.</li>
