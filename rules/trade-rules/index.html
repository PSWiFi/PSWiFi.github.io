</div>
<hr />

This page contains important information about the trade rules. Read through all of the information carefully if you plan to participate in trading in the room.
<br />
<br />
We facilitate trading in all main series Pok&eacute;mon games that are currently supported by official Nintendo Online services. <u>This includes all 3DS and Switch titles.</u>
<br />
<br />
<span class="fw-bold">Reminder:</span> <span class="fw-bold warn">TRADING HACKED OR ILLEGAL POKEMON IS STRICTLY BANNED.</span>
<br />
<br />
<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="traderule1"><span class="fw-bold">1. You must provide any information about a Pok&eacute;mon if asked by a member of Staff.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>In the event a member of <code>/roomstaff</code> contacts you in regards to a room trade, you are obligated to provide the information requested.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="traderule2"><span class="fw-bold">2. You must be able to provide proof for all transactions if proof is required.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>See the <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/proof-guidelines/min-requirement/">Proofing Requirements</a> page for more information about the types of Pok&eacute;mon that need proof to trade. Proofing is generally reserved for high value
      Pok&eacute;mon to help certify legitimacy.</p>

    <p>Proof should come from the person trading the high value Pok&eacute;mon. The original owner of the Pok&eacute;mon is not obligated to provide the proofing on request.</p>

    <p>It is recommended to save proof links you receive from trades in the room if you wish to further trade the Pok&eacute;mon around. Avoid asking for proof links you did not save.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="traderule3"><span class="fw-bold">3. You may only trade in-game Pok&eacute;mon, items, or services.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Trading Pok&eacute;mon for money, possessions, or event distribution codes is banned. This is to prevent risk of scams.</p>

    <p>Event distribution codes can be given away for free if you wish on a first-come-first-served basis. You may also ask users to redeem event codes on your behalf, but be cautious of the potential scam risk involved in doing so.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="traderule4"><span class="fw-bold">4. Limit your trade posts to a singular message.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Once you have found a trade partner you can take the trade discussion to private messages. Try to keep trade posts once per 20 lines to reduce clutter.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="traderule5"><span class="fw-bold">5. Tag your trade post to make people aware of the game you are trying to trade in.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Use tags such as [Gen 6] [Gen 7] [LGPE] [SwSh] [BDSP] [PLA]. We also recommend using a LF (Looking For) and (For Trade) format when making a trade post.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Example:</span> LF: Hidden Ability Bulbasaur / FT: Hidden Ability Charmander or Squirtle [SWSH]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="traderule6"><span class="fw-bold">6. Multiple-for-one, GTS &amp; HOME trades are discouraged.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>This is to prevent risk of scams, multiple-for-one trades are not strictly banned, but be aware of the scam risk involved with accepting these types of trade deals.</p>

    <p>Trading within Pok&eacute;mon HOME is unsupported by PS! Wi-Fi, do so at your own risk. It's recommended to trade within official main series games where possible.</p>

    <u>Regarding trade evolutions, and training services:</u><br />

    <p>You may offer to evolve or train a Pok&eacute;mon for other users but should come to an agreement on the expected timeframe that the transation/deal will be completed. If no timeframe is agreed in private between both parties, Room Staff may intervene upon receiving a report about an incomplete trade <span class="fw-bold">after 24 hours has passed</span>.</p>

    <p>If you are offering a reward to a player in return for evolution or training services, ensure your reward is ready to trade before making the deal. 
      
    <p>If you are the one evolving or training a Pok&eacute;mon for somebody else, ensure you have the resources to do so before making the deal. Keep the person you are trading with well informed and remain in regular contact to avoid these types of trade deals <u>being treated as scams</u>.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Wonder Card injection is permitted under strict conditions, you must inject the card properly and be absolutely certain of this. You will be held responsible for illegal Pok&eacute;mon as a result of an incorrectly injected Wonder Card.</p>

    <p>If the Wonder Card is injected properly this is considered okay by PS! Wi-Fi trading standard, as the end result is no different to having legitimately obtained the event distribution from a code or location.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Save restores are permitted under the condition that it does not produce an illegal result, such as save restoring over a story altering choice.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Example of permitted use:</span> Using a save restore to catch a legendary more than once.</p>

    <p><span class="fw-bold">Example of banned use:</span> Using save restores to capture Regidrago when Regieleki has already been caught on the same save file.</p>

  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">Can I trade this Pok&eacute;mon?</h1>
</div>
<hr />

Whether you can trade a Pok&eacute;mon or not depends on how the Pok&eacute;mon was obtained, and how it ended up in your hands. Find the situation that best applies to you in the list below:<br /><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="selfobtained"><span class="fw-bold">I caught, claimed or hatched it myself. &#9989;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Pok&eacute;mon obtained through regular gameplay on an official, unmodified game can be traded in the room. Be sure to check the Proof Guidelines to see if it needs proof.</p>

    <p>RNG abuse is also permitted as this simply takes advantage of understanding how the game generates the details of the Pok&eacute;mon in order to achieve a desirable result.</p>

    <p>Cloning is also permitted if done properly, properly cloned Pok&eacute;mon are no different to the original entity.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="obtainedintrade"><span class="fw-bold">Someone traded it to me/I won a Giveaway in the Wi-Fi room, it came with proof. &#9989;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Chances are this Pok&eacute;mon can be traded, contact a member of Room Staff if you are uncertain/suspicious about a Pok&eacute;mon you have received in room trades or giveaways.</p>
  </div>

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="linktradeegg"><span class="fw-bold">It is (or was hatched from) a flawless shiny egg from a Link Trade in Gen 8/9. &#128528;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>You may NOT trade this Pok&eacute;mon in the room. Flawless shiny Pok&eacute;mon originating from Link Trades are a large source of hacks. As a result there is a blanket ban on all flawless shiny eggs obtained in link trades in Generation 8 & 9 games.
    </p>

    <p>If your egg is self-obtained, then make sure to hatch the Pok&eacute;mon inside before trading it around.</p>

    <p>This rule also extends to flawless (6IV) Manaphy in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="raregen3event"><span class="fw-bold">It is a rare event from Gen 3. &#128528;</span>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>The only event Pok&eacute;mon from generation 3 that can be traded are those that come from items, such as Old Sea Map Mew and Pok&eacute;mon encountered from boat tickets. Otherwise, these Pok&eacute;mon cannot be traded in the room.</p>
  </div>
</div><br />

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;" id="alteredchainlength"><span class="fw-bold">I altered the length of a chained Pok&eacute;mon to achieve a result faster. &#128528;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Altering the length of chains is permitted as long as this does not alter the generation of Pok&eacute;mon in any way. If your chain was achieved naturally or via RNG abuse, this rule does not apply to your Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

    <p>If you have altered the chain length to achieve a result, this should be noted during the trade to make sure the receiver is aware. This can be noted in private messages, on trade sheets, or in Giveaway forms.</p>

  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Cloning using Sysbots is permitted, under the assumption that the internal details of the Pok&eacute;mon are not altered in any way as a result of using one.</p>

    <p><u>If you are found to be cloning using "bad" Sysbots that alter Pok&eacute;mon data, you may be punished as a result of doing so. PS! Wi-Fi are not affiliated with any bot hosts!</u></p>

    <p>Consider using our <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/misc/cloning/">approved cloning service</a> instead, or speak with the owner of the bot before using it to avoid creating unintentionally hacked Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
