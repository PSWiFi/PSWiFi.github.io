  <span class="fw-bold">Interested in trading Pokémon and expanding your collection?</span> This page contains information about our Trade Rules. If you are new to trading in PS! Wi-Fi we encourage you to read the entire page before making a trade
  post.
</p>

As stated in the Room Rules, we facilitate trading in all main series Pokémon games that are currently supported by official Nintendo Online services. <u>This includes all 3DS and Switch titles.</u><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We do not support trading in Pokémon HOME and Pokémon GO.</span><br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Trade Rules:</span></h4>

<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You must provide any and all information about a Pokémon if asked by a staff member.</span></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You must be able to provide proof for all transactions if your Pokémon requires proof.</span> See the Proofing Guidelines for more information. Proof should come from the person who traded you the Pokémon. The original
    owner does
    not have an obligation to provide proof if they did not give you the Pokémon. Please do not ask staff for proof that you lost or did not save </li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You may only trade in-game Pokémon, items, or services.</span> Trading Pokémon for money, possessions, or codes is banned.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Limit your trade posts to a singular message.</span> Once you have found a trade partner you can take the trade discussion to private messages. Try to keep trade posts once per 20 lines to reduce clutter. </li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Tag your trade post accordingly so people are aware of the game you are trying to trade in.</span> Use tags such as [Gen 6] [Gen 7] [LGPE] [SwSh] [BDSP] [PLA].</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">We discourage trading over the GTS, and multiple-for-one trades.</span> This is to prevent the risk of scams.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Trading of physical event Pokémon codes is forbidden. This is also to prevent scams.</span> You may request that someone redeems a code for you as a gesture of kindness, do this at your own risk as we are unable to verify
    a scam
    if it occurs.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">WC injections and save restores for legends are permitted if performed correctly.</span> Contact a member of /roomstaff with any concerns.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">All forms of seed injection are strictly BANNED in this room.</span> If you are caught using seed injections, you will be punished.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Do not attempt to expose someone in the chat for a trade rule violation.</span> Report the violation to a member of /roomstaff and we will handle it accordingly. Do not post public blacklists.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Once you trade a Pokémon away you lose control over it.</span> Do not attempt to control what a user does with a Pokémon you have traded to them. It is their Pokémon now and the Pokémon you traded for is yours.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Trade in Pokémon HOME at your own risk. We do not support or facilitate Pokémon HOME trading and encourage in-game trading instead.</span>

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Can I trade this Pokémon?</span></h4>
Whether you can trade a Pokémon or not depends on how the Pokémon was obtained, and how it ended up in your hands. Find the situation that best applies to you in the list below:<br /><br />

<ul>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">I caught, claimed or hatched it myself:</span> Pokémon obtained through regular gameplay on an unmodified game cartridge can be traded in the room, be sure to check the proof guidelines to see if it needs proof.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Someone traded it to me in the Wi-Fi room with proof, it looks legitimate:</span> Chances are this Pokémon can be traded, contact a member of staff if you’re uncertain for any reason.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">This Pokémon was obtained by an in-game glitch or exploit:</span> Any Pokémon obtained by glitches that alter Pokémon data are banned from trading in the Wi-Fi room, this includes but is not limited to:</li>
  - 8F, Coin Case and Mimic exploits in Virtual Console.<br>
  - Glitches that result in otherwise unreleased/unobtainable Pokémon, such as void glitching/tweaking.<br>
  - Pokémon from fangames, modified game cartridges and event distribution cartridges.<br>
  - “Menu glitches” in Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl.<br>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Cute Charm glitch is permitted since it is standard TID/SID RNG abuse that takes advantage of a normal game mechanic.</span></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">I won it from a giveaway in the Wi-Fi room:</span> This should be all right to trade. Make sure you include the proof that came with it if any was available. If you win a Pokémon and then are suspicious about it for any
    reason,
    please ask a staff member to investigate.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">I got it from a stranger on Y-Comm, Wonder/Surprise Trade, or GTS/GWS:</span> You may NOT trade this Pokémon in the room. The majority of "good" Pokémon from these places are hacked. Trading these Pokémon will result in a
    ban.
  </li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">It is a Pokémon from a PokéRadar chain of 99 in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl:</span> If your chain was achieved naturally or via RNG abuse this rule does not apply to your Pokémon, however if your PokéRadar chain length
    was
    altered by the use of third party tools you must indicate this on the proofing of your Pokémon, in your trade sheet, or in the Giveaway form tagged with “99chain”. We permit the use of chain length altering as this does not affect the Pokémon
    generation in any way. <u>This rule still applies if you are not the original obtainer of the Pokémon.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">It is (or was hatched from) a flawless shiny egg originating from a Link Trade in gen 8:</span> You may NOT trade this Pokémon in the room. Flawless shiny Pokémon originating from Link Trades are a large source of hacks,
    as a
    result they cannot be traded in the room. This rule also extends to the BDSP event Manaphy. <u>Flawless Manaphy still in their egg can not be traded in the room, please hatch them first.</u></li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">It is a shiny Pokémon still in its egg from generation 8:</span> You may NOT trade this Pokémon in the room. Shiny Pokémon still in eggs are a potential scam risk and for this reason they cannot be traded. Hatch the
    Pokémon before
    attempting to trade. The only exception to this rule is official Wi-Fi events as every entry is thoroughly checked by Wi-Fi staff, and traded to you by a member of our trusted helper team.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">I got it from a random raid on Discord or another outside community:</span> These Pokémon can be traded at your own risk. If a Pokémon from an outside source turns out to be illegal, you will be held responsible.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">I got it from a friend/relative, a used game, eBay, or another trading community:</span> Do not trade Pokémon purchased from other websites here as most of them will end up being hacked. This does not include Pokémon
    obtained from
    purchased codes.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">A user gave me legendaries/shinies/etc for free in PMs:</span> Tell a staff member immediately. We may ask you to help us by getting the Pokémon in order to show us, but suspicious Pokémon will never be allowed to be
    traded in the
    room. Do NOT ask users to trade you suspicious Pokémon; you are guilty as well if you are asking for Pokémon that are forbidden from trade in the Wi-Fi room. We have blacklisted multiple users for hosting unapproved giveaways of hacked
    Pokémon in PMs.
  </li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">It is a rare event from generation 3:</span> The only event Pokémon from generation 3 that can be traded are those that come from items, such as Old Sea Map Mew and Pokémon encountered from boat tickets. Otherwise, these
    events
    CANNOT be traded in the Wi-Fi room.
  </li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">I genned or hacked this Pokémon:</span> Please let staff know that you are trying to trade a self-hacked Pokémon so you can be banned from the room forever.</li>
