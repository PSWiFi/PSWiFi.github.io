    </div>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p><span class="fw-bold warn"><u>ALL HACKS AND HACKING METHODS ARE STRICTLY BANNED! DO NOT OFFER, ASK FOR, OR DISCUSS HACKING IN THE WI-FI ROOM OR IN PRIVATE MESSAGES. DO NOT TRADE HACKED POK&eacute;MON IN THE WI-FI ROOM!</u></span></p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">Trading self-hacked Pok&eacute;mon, including those that come from misuse of third-party tools or applications will be evaluated by staff on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>If we believe this was an act of carelessness or ignorance, you will be met with a blacklist with the chance to appeal 6 months from the date of the blacklist.</li>
            <li>If we believe this was an act of malice, you will be met with a blacklist with no chance to appeal, this will last 12 months from the date of the blacklist.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In most cases trading hacked Pok&eacute;mon will result in a ban (2 DAYS). In more extreme cases we may decide to apply more strict punishment such as a weekban (7 DAYS) or a blacklist (365 DAYS). This rule extends to knowingly trading suspicious Pok&eacute;mon from outside sources that later find to be hacked. If you are found to be distributing Pok&eacute;mon you have hacked/genned yourself you will be punished with an immediate blacklist.</p>

        <p>If you believe that you have recieved a hacked Pok&eacute;mon from a member of the community, report it to a member of Room Staff immediately! Try to provide as much information as you can, including logs of the conversation with the user in question.</p>
