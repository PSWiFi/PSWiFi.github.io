  <h5 class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold">The Hacked Pok&eacute;mon Rule:</span></h5>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>
      <span class="fw-bold warn">
        <u>ALL HACKS AND HACKING METHODS ARE STRICTLY BANNED! DO NOT TRADE HACKED POK&eacute;MON IN THE WI-FI ROOM!</u>
      </span>
    </p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Trading self-hacked Pok&eacute;mon, including those that come from misuse of third-party tools or applications will be evaluated by staff on a case-by-case basis.</span>
    <ol>
      <li>If we believe this was an act of carelessness or ignorance, you will be met with a blacklist with the chance to appeal 6 months from the date of the blacklist.</li>
      <li>If we believe this was an act of malice, you will be met with a blacklist with no chance to appeal, this will last 12 months from the date of the blacklist.</li>
    </ol>

    Trading any hacked Pok&eacute;mon once will result in a roomban in most cases, and multiple counts of trading hacked Pok&eacute;mon will result in more severe punishments, such as a weekban or blacklist. This rule extends to knowingly trading
    suspicious Pok&eacute;mon from outside sources that are found to be hacked.
    <br />
    <br />
    Do not offer, ask for, or discuss hacking in Wi-Fi or in private messages. If you are found to
    be trading Pok&eacute;mon you have edited/created in any way, you will be punished with a room
    blacklist for self-hacking Pok&eacute;mon. If you have been offered a hacked Pok&eacute;mon from
    a user in the room, be sure to report it to a member of <code>/roomstaff</code> immediately!

  <h5 class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold">The Scammer Rule:</span></h5>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    Scamming once leads to a blacklist, and multiple counts of scamming will result in a permanent blacklist. This rule is straight and narrow, <span class="fw-bold warn">do not attempt to scam anybody.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    A scam is defined by a trade that did not meet the agreement between both concerned parties.
    For example, lying about IVs or a Pok&eacute;mon's origin. Conducting a giveaway and not giving
    the winner their Pok&eacute;mon is also considered a scam.
