  <h1 class="text-light text-center pt-3 pb-3">General Rules</h1>
</div><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">The hacked Pokémon rule...</span></h4>
<p style="color:red"><span class="fw-bold"><u>DO NOT TRADE HACKED POKEMON IN THE WI-FI ROOM!</span></u></p>

<span class="fw-bold">Trading self-hacked Pokémon, including those that come from misuse of third-party tools or applications will be evaluated by staff on a case-by-case basis.</span><br />

<ol>- If we believe this was an act of carelessness or ignorance, you will be met with a blacklist with the chance to appeal <u>6 months from the date of the blacklist.</u><br />

  - If we believe this was an act of malice, you will be met with a blacklist with no chance to appeal, this will last <u>12 months from the date of the blacklist.</u></ol>

<u>Trading any hacked Pokémon once</u> will result in a roomban in most cases, and multiple counts of trading hacked Pokémon will result in more severe punishments, weekban or blacklist. This rule extends to knowingly trading suspicious Pokémon
from outside sources that are found to be hacked. <br /> <br />

<u>Do not offer, ask for or discuss hacking in Wi-Fi or in private messages.</u> If you are found to be trading Pokémon you have edited/created in any way, you will be punished with a room blacklist for self-hacking Pokémon. If you have been
offered a hacked Pokémon from a user in the room, be sure to report it to a member of <code>/roomstaff</code> immediately!<br /> <br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">The scammer rule...</span></h4>
Scamming once leads to a blacklist, and multiple counts of scamming will result in a permanent blacklist. A scam is defined by a trade that did not meet the agreement between both concerned parties. For example, lying about IVs or Pokémon origin,
conducting a giveaway and not giving the winner their Pokémon is also considered a scam. This rule is straight and narrow, do not attempt to scam anybody. <br /> <br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">The poor presence rule...</span></h4>
If you have received a blacklist for exceptionally poor behavior and/or presence you will not be given the opportunity to appeal. If you have sufficient evidence to suggest your blacklist was unjustified, contact a Room Owner. Use <code>/roomstaff</code> to
check for an active Room Owner.<br /> <br />
<p style="color:red"><u><span class="fw-bold">Disclaimer:</span></u> The final verdict of any moderation action will always remain at the discretion of Wi-Fi <code>/roomstaff</code>.
