 This page contains important information about the rules of the chatroom. Read through all of the information carefully if you plan to participate in activities and discussions in the room.<br /><br />

 <span class="fw-bold" style="color:#b80303;">Disclaimer:</span></u> The final verdict of any moderation action will always remain at the discretion of Wi-Fi <code>/roomstaff</code>. If you have any questions or concerns about a moderation action, contact a member of the Room Staff team.<br /><br />

  <h5 class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold">The Hacked Pokémon Rule:</span></h5>
  <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #d1d1d1;">
    <p style="color:#b80303;"><span class="fw-bold"><u>ALL HACKS AND HACKING METHODS ARE SCRICTLY BANNED! DO NOT TRADE HACKED POKÉMON IN THE WI-FI ROOM!</span></u></p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Trading self-hacked Pokémon, including those that come from misuse of third-party tools or applications will be evaluated by staff on a case-by-case basis.</span>
    <ol>
      <li>If we believe this was an act of carelessness or ignorance, you will be met with a blacklist with the chance to appeal 6 months from the date of the blacklist.</li>
      <li>If we believe this was an act of malice, you will be met with a blacklist with no chance to appeal, this will last 12 months from the date of the blacklist.</li>
    </ol>

    Trading any hacked Pokémon once will result in a roomban in most cases, and multiple counts of trading hacked Pokémon will result in more severe punishments, such as a weekban or blacklist. This rule extends to knowingly trading suspicious Pokémon
    from outside sources that are found to be hacked. <br /> <br />

    Do not offer, ask for, or discuss hacking in Wi-Fi or in private messages. If you are found to be trading Pokémon you have edited/created in any way, you will be punished with a room blacklist for self-hacking Pokémon. If you have been
    offered a hacked Pokémon from a user in the room, be sure to report it to a member of <code>/roomstaff</code> immediately!<br /><br />
