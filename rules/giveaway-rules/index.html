<div class="card border-dark">
    <h5 class="card-header text-light purple"><span class="fw-bold">What are Giveaways?</span></h5>
    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>Giveaways are a way for users in Wi-Fi to give Pok&eacute;mon back to the community in Sword/Shield or Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. We have two types of giveaways: Lotto and Question.</p>

        <span class="fw-bold">Lotto - </span> These are luck based, click join and hope for the best.<br />
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Question - </span> These are skill based, test your knowledge and win some amazing prizes!</p>

        <p>
            Pok&eacute;mon in our Giveaways are usually considered high value or high quality, if you are a collector we advise you turn on Giveaway notifications so you don't miss any. This can be done by typing <code>/rfaq ga</code> into Wi-Fi chat and
            clicking the "Notify" button! This will ensure you are pinged as and when new Giveaways occur.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember that all Giveaways hosted by users in the room are done through acts of kindness and are generally unscheduled, so please do not ask questions regarding when the next Giveaway will be, and avoid complaining if you don't manage to win
            a desirable Giveaway.

            <b>Only self-obtained Pok&eacute;mon can be given away</b>, do not give away someone elses Pok&eacute;mon. If you did not capture, or redeem the Pok&eacute;mon on your console then it is not self-obtained. The only exception to this rule is the
            monthly Official Giveaway.
