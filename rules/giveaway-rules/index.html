<span class="fw-bold">So you are looking to host or join giveaways? Look no further!</span> This page contains information about our Giveaway Guidelines. Here you will learn about the Giveaway Rules, and we will guide you on how to host a Giveaway in
the room! <u>Be sure to read the entire page before attempting to participate in Giveaways</u>, PM a member of Room Staff if you have any questions.<br /> <br />

<span class="fw-bold">We currently support Official Giveaways in the following Pokémon titles:</span><br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="color:blue"><span class="fw-bold">Sword & Shield - Indicated by the BLUE background</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="color:purple"><span class="fw-bold">Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl - Indicated by the PURPLE background</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<span class="fw-bold">We do not support Official Giveaways in previous generations or from Legends: Arceus/Pokémon HOME.</span><br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">What are Giveaways?</span></h4>
Giveaways are a way for users in Wi-Fi to give Pokémon back to the community on Sword/Shield or Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. We have two types of giveaways: Lotto and Question.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Lotto - </span> These are luck based, click join and hope for the best.<br />

<span class="fw-bold">Question - </span> These are skill based, test your Pokémon knowledge and win some amazing prizes!<br /><br />

Pokémon in our giveaways are usually considered high value or high quality, if you are a collector we advise you turn on Giveaway notifications so you don't miss any. This can be done by typing /rfaq GA into Wi-Fi chat and clicking the "Notify"
button! This will ensure you are pinged as and when new Giveaways occur.<br /><br />

Remember that all giveaways hosted by users in the room are done through acts of kindness and are generally unscheduled, so please do not ask questions regarding when the next giveaway will be, and avoid complaining if you don’t manage to win a
desirable giveaway.<br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Which Pokémon can be given away?</span></h4>
Your Pokémon must meet the following minimum requirement to be given away through our room plugin:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Shiny Pokémon of any kind</li>
  <li>Event Pokémon of any kind</li>
  <li>Pokémon with transfer exclusive movesets</li>
  <li>Non-shiny flawless Pokémon</li>
  <li>Non-shiny battle ready Pokémon - (Hypertraining is permitted)</li>
</ul>

In <span class="fw-bold">Sword/Shield and Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl</span>, flawed breedjects can be given away unofficially. (Example: Mudkip, Adamant, 31/x/31/31/31/31)<br />
In <span class="fw-bold">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span>, non-shiny Pokémon can be given away unofficially. (Example: Random catch Alpha Spiritomb with 3 perfect IVs)<br />
Physical event distribution codes are also permitted to be given away unofficially.<br /><br />

An unofficial giveaway means you can simply ask users in the chat to PM you to recieve a Pokémon of your choice, these do not need to go through our Giveaway Form.<br /><br />

<ul>
  <li>Anything not listed above</li>
