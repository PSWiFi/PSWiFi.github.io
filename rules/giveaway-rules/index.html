     <hr />

     This page contains important information about the Giveaway rules. Read through all of the information carefully if you plan to participate in joining or hosting Giveaways in the room.<br /><br />

     <div class="card border-dark">
      <h5 class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold">What are Giveaways?</span></h5>
      <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #d1d1d1;">
        <p>Giveaways are a way for users in Wi-Fi to give Pokémon back to the community in Sword/Shield or Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl. We have two types of giveaways: Lotto and Question.</p>
        
        <span class="fw-bold">Lotto - </span> These are luck based, click join and hope for the best.<br />
        <p><span class="fw-bold">Question - </span> These are skill based, test your knowledge and win some amazing prizes!</p>

        <p>Pokémon in our Giveaways are usually considered high value or high quality, if you are a collector we advise you turn on Giveaway notifications so you don't miss any. This can be done by typing <code>/rfaq ga</code> into Wi-Fi chat and clicking the "Notify" button! This will ensure you are pinged as and when new Giveaways occur.</p>

        <p>Remember that all Giveaways hosted by users in the room are done through acts of kindness and are generally unscheduled, so please do not ask questions regarding when the next Giveaway will be, and avoid complaining if you don't manage to win a desirable Giveaway.</p>

        <p><span class="fw-bold">We currently support Official Giveaways in the following Pokémon titles:</span></p>

        <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold">1. You may only give away legitimate, self-obtained Pokémon.</span>

         <p>Only self-obtained Pokémon can be given away, do not give away someone elses Pokémon. If you did not capture, or redeem the Pokémon on your console then it is not self-obtained. The only exception to this rule is the monthly Official Giveaway.</p>
       </div>
     </div><br />

       <div class="card border-dark">
        <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #470049;"><span class="fw-bold">2. If your Pokémon needs proof to trade it needs proof to be given away.</span>
