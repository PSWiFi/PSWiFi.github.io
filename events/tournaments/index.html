</div>

<h4><span class="fw-bold">General Rules:</span></h4>

<span class="fw-bold">The following ruleset applies to all types of tour competitions in the PS! Wi-Fi room:</span><br />

<ol>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Play fair & play respectfully</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Do not timer stall, do not trash talk players</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Use of hacked Pokémon is strictly banned and has a severe penalty</span>.</li> If you are uncertain about a Pokémon, do not use it.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">You must always follow tier & format rules, including custom modifiers when these rules are featured</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Disputes as a result of timer will go as follows</span>:
    <ul>
      <li>Either the games choice of who wins on screen as victor is what you both can go by... or if both sides agree one is massively favored over the other in the end state. Always reach out to a helper over timer disputes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="fw-bold">Monthlies are hosted twice the day after the Official Giveaway date just before 2PM-7PM EST accordingly</span>. Participating in more than one will result in forfeiting previously earned prizes.</li
  <li><span class="fw-bold">All tiers chosen will be focused towards the best and newest supported game releases</span>.</li>
</ol>

<span class="fw-bold">Failure to comply with the rules will result in disqualification and repeat offenses will result in a ban from participation in any capacity. By participating in our tournaments, you accept responsibility for any rule breaks that may occur due to your participation. Be sure to remain in-line with the rules.</span><br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Nugget Bridge Guidelines:</span></h4>

<ol>
  <li>All battles take place <u>in-game and not on the sim</u>. You may only face each trainer once per month per tier. Make sure to take a picture of the win or loss screen and upload it online for the win report! </li>
  <ul>
    Here is a directory for useful links regarding Nugget Bridge:

      <li>Don’t forget the number you used to sign up!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You can look for battles in Wi-Fi by saying something along the lines of “LF: Nugget Bridge battle”. Organize the battle in PMs, not in chat.</li>
  <li>Thrown matches, using non-viable teams, and / or breaking previously stated rules will result in 0 WP being awarded. Awarded WP and the Nugget Bridge page will update each time a helper checks submitted battles. Please be patient; these are user-updated and may take a bit of time.</li>
