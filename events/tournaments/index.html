  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <span class="fw-bold">Important Information:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>All battles take place <u>in-game</u>, this means you cannot participate in Nugget Bridge battles using Showdown.</li>
      <li>You may only face each trainer once per month per tier. Make sure to take a picture of the win or loss screen and upload it online for the win report!</li>
      <li>You can look for battles in Wi-Fi by saying something along the lines of “LF: Nugget Bridge battle”. Organize the battle in PMs, not in chat.</li>
      <li>Thrown matches, using non-viable teams, and / or breaking previously stated rules will result in 0 WP being awarded. Awarded WP and the Nugget Bridge page will update each time a helper checks submitted battles. Please be patient; these are user-updated and may take a bit of time.</li>

    <span class="fw-bold">Battle Report Information:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Nugget Bridge, Practice Tours, and the Monthly all report in battles in the same fashion. The requirements for a battle report are; a clear visual indication of the Win/Loss screen, being either a screenshot/picture or recording of the moments leading up to the Win/Loss screen, if prompted about "any issues to note" they must relate to issues with rules being broken or poor sportsman ship or some other issue impeding the match (If you wish to direct feedback in general feel free to reach out to Tour Leaders).</p>

    <p>When the battle comes towards the end both battlers should be prepared to capture the Win/Loss screen regardless of the winner or loser, Assuming you took a picture using your console go to your album and upload it wherever your able and use that or an alternative site for hosting such as discord or imgur or twitter same with video capture. You can also use other methods to capture the image such as a phone or camera as long as its clear and legible.</p><hr />
