</div>
 <div class="card-body" style="background-color: #d1d1d1;">
  <ol>
    <li>All battles take place <u>in-game and not on the sim</u>. You may only face each trainer once per month per tier. Make sure to take a picture of the win or loss screen and upload it online for the win report!</li><br />
    <li>You can look for battles in Wi-Fi by saying something along the lines of “LF: Nugget Bridge battle”. Organize the battle in PMs, not in chat.</li><br />
    <li>Thrown matches, using non-viable teams, and / or breaking previously stated rules will result in 0 WP being awarded. Awarded WP and the Nugget Bridge page will update each time a helper checks submitted battles. Please be patient; these are user-updated and may take a bit of time.</li>
