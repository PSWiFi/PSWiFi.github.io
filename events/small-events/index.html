        <h6 class="fw-bold">General Rules</h6>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Botting is prohibited in official competitions.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This extends to all types of automated play to keep competition at a level playing field.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Entries must be created inside the event timeframe.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This means you cannot prepare an entry prior to the start date of a new contest or competition.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Forged entries will be disqualified.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use authentic submissions; fake submissions are likely to be met with room punishment.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Two users submitting the same entry outside of team events will be disqualified.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is for obvious reasons, you must make your own individual effort when creating an event submission.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Inappropriate nicknames will be immediately disqualified.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Having an inappropriate nickname breaks <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global PS! rules</a> and is not acceptable.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">In most cases, entries must remain anonymous.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>For events where entries are private, do not leak your entry to anyone else until the event has concluded.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Do not ask / encourage others to vote towards your entry.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep it fair! Asking friends to vote for your entry grants you an unfair advantage and also breaks the anonymity rule.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Have fun! Enjoy yourself, that is what small events are all about.</span></li>
        </ol>
