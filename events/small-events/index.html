  <ol>
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Botting is prohibited in official competitions</span>. This extends to all types of automated play.</li><br />
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Ensure entries are created within the event's timeframe; do not prepare entries in advance</span>, This means you cannot prepare an entry prior to the start date of a new contest or competition.</li><br />
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Forged entries will be disqualified</span>. Use authentic submissions; fake submissions are likely to be met with room punishment.</li><br />
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Two users submitting the same entry outside of team events will be disqualified</span>.</li><br />
    <li><span class="fw-bold">Inappropriate nicknames will be disqualified</span>. This breaks <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/rules">Global PS! rules</a> and is not acceptable.</li><br />
