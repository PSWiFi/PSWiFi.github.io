<p><span class="fw-bold">Want to participate in Official Giveaways? Awesome!</span> This page contains information about rules and guidelines of the monthly Official Wi-Fi Giveaway, outlining everything you need to know in order to participate. Be sure to read through all of the information on this page carefully.</p>

<p>Once a month, PS! Wi-Fi staff and event helpers host a giveaway that typically lasts <span class="fw-bold">12+ hours</span>, featuring a bunch of high value Pok&eacute;mon that you can get your hands on! Currently, the official giveaway is focused on Scarlet/Violet, but the aim is to prioritize new games as/when they release when possible.</p>

<p>To participate, all you need to do is have access to a Nintendo Switch with the currently supported game, and a Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription to receive the Pokemon if you win! If you meet these conditions simply hop into the Wi-Fi room on the day of the Giveaway and click <code class="fw-bold">Join</code> on the ongoing giveaways to be entered into a random draw.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">General Rules</h6>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Do not double dip.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This means that you should not enter a giveaway for a Pok&eacute;mon you have already won. You may be banned from entering giveaways for a week if this occurs.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Disrespect will not be tolerated.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Any negativity towards helpers, leadership, or the giveaways themselves will result in you being removed from the event, we do not want this.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Avoid complaining if you do not win.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Just keep joining! Giveaway wins are based on luck, you have to be lucky enough to win eventually, right?</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">You have 10 minutes to acknowledge a win.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>After 10 minutes of no communication have passed you will be banned from entering giveaways, be prompt when redeeming your prize.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">You must own the game the giveaway is being held on.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Giveaway prizes cannot be sent to a different game or traded through Pok&eacute;mon HOME. Do not enter if you do not own the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Have your OT/TID or a self obtained Pok&eacute;mon ready for the giveaway host.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This helps to keep the internal ship sailing smoothly, meaning extra availability for helpers and more giveaways being hosted.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Have fun! Enjoy yourself, that is the official giveaway is all about.</span></li>
