        <span class="fw-bold">Do not double-dip</span>. This means do not join a
        Giveaway of a Pok&eacute;mon you have previously won in the ongoing
        giveaway.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are caught double-dipping, you will be met with a week-long
          Giveaway Ban which prevents you from joining any Giveaways for a week.
          Don't miss out on the entire OGA by double-dipping!
