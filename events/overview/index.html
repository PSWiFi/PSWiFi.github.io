<span class="fw-bold">Curious about our event sections? Great! We are always looking for committed helpers to our event sections</span>. This page contains a brief overview on what being an Event Helper entails.<br /> <br />

Being an Event Helper allows you to get behind the scenes of how our events work and be actively involved in them. You will be a part of a huge, supportive team that will be able to assist you and work alongside you. Event Helpers further define
the vision for our room of Wi-Fi: a fun place for everyone to come and play Pokémon.<br /><br />

You will only be able to help with a maximum of two event archetypes at any given time, we will not allow you to do more than this as you simply won’t have enough time. Be certain that you understand helping out as an Event Helper is a commitment &mdash; if you do not have the time or capacity to help out this is fine, but please take this into consideration before applying. If you have any more questions, please ask the leaders of each event archetype &mdash; they’re listed at the top of each description of their archetype. We hope to have you on our
team!<br /><br />

We have four helper sections that you can apply for: Small Events, Tournaments, Prizes, and Giveaways. Each section will be covered individually below.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">We encourage you to apply for any section you take an interest in! It can never hurt to apply even if you are rejected, just try again with the provided feedback if you are rejected</span>!<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Before applying to be an Event Helper, please note that we use our communication to discuss events on <u>Discord</u></span>. If you do not have a Discord account and get accepted as an Event Helper, a staff member will be able to asist you in setting up an account. If you do not wish to make a Discord account, then unfortunately it is not possible to be an Event Helper given that this is where our events are planned.<br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Small Events:</span></h4>
<span class="fw-bold">Current Leaders:</span> <span style="color:#8AA139;">Argynt</span> & <span style="color:#E30DD4;">Nicolic</span>! <br /><br />
Becoming a Wi-Fi Small Events Helper allows you to use your creativity by hosting your own fun event ideas for the following titles: Sword & Shield, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, and Pokémon: Legends Arceus! 
It’s a flexible role where the greatest strength is one’s own imagination, with the events ranging from small tournaments to large scale competitions. If you choose this role, you’re expected to run or help with an event at least once every three months, which allows you to participate in a way that best suits your schedule. 
If you have a great idea and don’t know how to approach it, other members in Small Events can help, too!<br /><br />

There are many types of events that you can get involved in! Here are a few examples of events hosted by us in the past:

<ul>
  <li>Competitive (e.g. Face Off, Treasure Hunt, Digging Contest, etc.)</li>
  <li>Hunting (e.g. Hatching Contest, Secret Santa & Easter Eggs, etc.)</li>
  <li>Creativity (e.g. League Card Contest, etc.)</li>
  <li>Trivia</li>
  <li>And many more!</li>
</ul>

Be sure to check out the room frequently and use <code>/rfaq events</code> to see what events are currently running in the room!

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Tournaments:</span></h4>
<span class="fw-bold">Current Leaders:</span> <span style="color:#18A743;">Loethalion</span> & <span style="color:#367D39">TheBlaah</span>! <br /><br />
Being a Wi-Fi Tour Helper requires a moderate amount of commitment; however, it is a way to give back to the people who run your current Tour Events! If you choose to go down the path of many Wi-Fi Event Helpers, you will also get a say in what
events we host, and you may be able to create your own events if approved!<br /><br />

Besides helping out at the large tournament that happens at the end of every month, what do Tour Helpers do? Plenty!<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Nugget Bridge Helper:</span></h6>
Nugget Bridge Helpers verify wins and losses through images submitted by players, and direct users on issues that might occur during a battle, such as disconnection, trouble reporting, timer decisions.<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Competitive Pokémon Obtainer:</span></h6>
Competitive Pokémon Obtainers may need to breed, receive events, and catch certain Pokémon we need for the monthly metagame. Once these Pokémon are obtained, they must be trained to be fully battle-ready and given to a Tour Leader.<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Sim Tour Helper:</span></h6>
The easiest role in tours &mdash; a Sim Tour Helper fosters discussion about that month’s tier and then types <code>.tour leaderboard</code> into the chat to let users practice battling in that tier on Showdown!. Sim Tour Helpers are expected to hype up and supervise
their tournament.<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Switch Tour Helper:</span></h6>
Possibly the hardest role in tours, however a role which has some room for your creativity &mdash; Switch Tour Helpers run our in-game practice tours at times which they can choose. This also means handling forms and documents related to running the
tournament.<br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Giveaways:</span></h4>
<span class="fw-bold">Current Leaders:</span> <span style="color:#40A610;">Shahafs</span> and <span style="color:#506CC8;">WigglyTree</span>! <br /><br />
Wi-Fi Giveaway Helpers are the ones in charge of Wi-Fi’s popular official giveaways! This role is a commitment to helping at least once every three months with official giveaways and allows you to have a say in what Pokémon you would like to see
given away. What do Giveaway Helpers do? Again, plenty!<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Theme Suggestions:</span></h6>
At the start of a giveaway cycle, all helpers are welcome to suggest a theme and a set of Pokémon to go with it. After a period of a few days, themes will be voted on to decide the official theme of that giveaway.<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Pokémon Obtainment:</span></h6>
Pokémon for giveaways are obtained entirely within the GA Team. Giveaway Obtainers are responsible for helping to obtain and train rare Pokémon to be given away.<br /><br />

<h6><span class="fw-bold">Pokémon Distribution:</span></h6>
On the day of an official giveaway, Giveaway Distributors will sign up for time slots in which to hold lottery giveaways. These giveaways will be recorded on the same spreadsheet as time slots.<br /><br />

The Wi-Fi Prizes Team is the lifeblood of Wi-Fi events. Made up of individuals who work to provide Pokémon for the Wi-Fi WP Shop, this team serves the important role of making sure there is a wide variety of prizes for event
participants.<br /><br />

Helpers will earn WP valuing at one-fifth of each contribution. For example, donating a 100 WP prize will earn the donator 20 WP.<br /><br />
