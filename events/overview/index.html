    <p>
      Being an Event Helper allows you to get behind the scenes of how our events work and be actively involved in them. You will be a part of a huge, supportive team that will be able to assist you and work alongside you. Event Helpers further
      define the vision for our room of Wi-Fi: a fun place for everyone to come and play Pok&eacute;mon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will only be able to help with a maximum of two event archetypes at any given time, we will not allow you to do more than this as you simply won't have enough time. Be certain that you understand helping out as an Event Helper is a
      commitment &mdash; if you do not have the time or capacity to help out this is fine, but please take this into consideration before applying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before applying to be an Event Helper, please note that we use our communication to discuss events on <u>Discord</u>. If you do not have a Discord account and get accepted as an Event Helper, a staff member will be able to asist you in
      setting up an account. If you do not wish to make a Discord account, then unfortunately it is not possible to be an Event Helper given that this is where our events are planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage you to apply for any section you take an interest in! A member of staff will contact you within 2 weeks of your application with the decision and/or feedback.
    </p>

We have four helper sections that you can apply for: Small Events, Tournaments, Prizes, and Giveaways. Each section will be covered individually below.

<div class="card border-dark">
  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #3059a5;"><span class="fw-bold">Small Events:</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Current Leaders:</span> <span class="argynt">Argynt</span> & <span class="nicolic">Nicolic</span>!</p>
    <p>Becoming a Wi-Fi Small Events Helper allows you to use your creativity by hosting your own fun event ideas for the following titles: Sword & Shield, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, and Pok&eacute;mon: Legends Arceus!</p>
    <p>It's a flexible role where the greatest strength is one's own imagination, with the events ranging from small tournaments to large scale competitions. If you choose this role, you're expected to run or help with an event at least once every
      three months, which allows you to participate in a way that best suits your schedule.</p>
    <p>If you have a great idea and don't know how to approach it, other members in Small Events can help, too!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>There are many types of events that you can get involved in! Here are a few examples of events hosted by us in the past:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Competitive (e.g. Face Off, Treasure Hunt, Digging Contest, etc.)</li>
      <li>Hunting (e.g. Hatching Contest, Secret Santa & Easter Eggs, etc.)</li>
      <li>Creativity (e.g. League Card Contest, etc.)</li>
      <li>Trivia</li>
      <li>And many more!</li>
    </ul>

    Be sure to check out the room frequently and use <code>/rfaq events</code> to see what events are currently running in the room!

    <p>Being a Wi-Fi Tour Helper requires a moderate amount of commitment; however, it is a way to give back to the people who run your current Tour Events! If you choose to go down the path of many Wi-Fi Event Helpers, you will also get a say in
      what events we host, and you may be able to create your own events if approved!</p>
    <p>Besides helping out at the large tournament that happens at the end of every month, what do Tour Helpers do? Plenty!</p>
