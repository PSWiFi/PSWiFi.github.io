    <div class="card-body card-bg">
        <p>As an Event Helper, you will gain valuable insight into the inner workings of our events and play an active role in their success. You will collaborate with a large, supportive team committed to fostering a welcoming and enjoyable environment for everyone to engage in Pok&eacute;mon gameplay and activites.</p>

        <p>Please note, helpers are limited to assisting with a maximum of two event categories at any given time. This ensures a manageable workload and allows you to fully dedicate yourself to each role. We encourage you to carefully consider your availability before applying, as being an Event Helper requires a meaningful commitment.</p>

        <p>Communication and coordination for events primarily take place via <u>Discord</u>. If you do not currently have a Discord account, a staff member will gladly assist you in setting one up upon acceptance. However, participation without Discord access is not possible due to the nature of our event planning.</p>

        <p>We invite you to apply for any sections that interest you. A staff member will review your application and respond with a decision or feedback within two weeks. We currently offer opportunities in four helper sections: Small Events, Tournaments, Prizes, and Giveaways. Each section is described in detail below.</p>
