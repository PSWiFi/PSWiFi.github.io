<p><span class="fw-bold">Want to understand how the Prize Shop works? You're in the right place!</span> This page contains information about rules and guidelines of the Prizes section and outlines everything you need to know in order to make a purchase! Be sure to read through the whole page carefully as it contains a lot of important information.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Points (WP) are a type of currency we have in Wi-Fi that you can use to spend on valuable Pok&eacute;mon and items from our Prize Shop! WP is earned through participation in Small Events and Tournaments throughout the month. Build up your WP count as high as you can and buy those rare prizes... or some Rare Pokeballs if you prefer!</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">All sales are FINAL.</span></li>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Item purchases are limited to a total of 30 items per month.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>No exceptions. You cannot order over 30 items in a single month as these deliveries cause significant burden for helpers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Delivery times are dependant on distributor availability.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sticking around in the room consistently after your purchase helps to speed up the delivery process.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Incorrectly filled orders may be deleted and/or ignored without warning!</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li> Be sure to fill in the form correctly so that your order does not get thrown in the trash.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Points are reset to a maximum of 15 at the end of every month.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is known as the "WP Reset", the WP reset typically occurs on the first Wednesday of every new month.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Pok&eacute;mon listed in the prize shop will not come with proof.</span></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This means you cannot trade the Pok&eacute;mon that need proof in the room as they are intended to be rare and exclusive prizes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Allow up to 2 weeks for your prize order to be delivered.</span></li>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">When does the WP reset occur?</span></li>
            <p>Typically the WP reset happens on the first Wednesday of every new month, this is subject to change, but will always be announced in the room through an rfaq.</p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Will I still receive my order that I placed before the reset?</span></li>
            <p>Yes! If you have placed an order before the reset, and had enough WP at the time, we will take this into account and still process your order, even if the reset has already occured.</p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">I ordered the wrong Pokemon! What can I do?</span></li>
            <p>Contact a Prize Leader to provide more information, please provide the ID of the prize you ordered and the prize you intended to order.</p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">I haven't been online for a month, can I still get my prize order?</span> </li>
            <p>Orders are deleted if we cannot find you within 30 days, if you have a valid reason for not coming online for a long time period, or a distributor did not reach out to you despite you being present in the room, reach out to a Prize Leader to see if they can further assist.</p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Can I ask an approved cloner to clone a shop prize?</span></li>
            <p>Yes, but keep in mind that some prizes may need proof to trade in Wi-Fi, given that prizes do not come with proof, this means you will be limited to cloning prizes that do not require any proof to trade in the room.</p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">I submitted an order twice, or by accident, what should I do?</span> </li>
            <p>Contact a prize leader and explain which order was submitted in error to see what they can do to help.</p>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Can I send WP to a friend?</span> </li>
            <p>You can send a total of 10 WP per month to a user of your choice, this is a service that is offered out of kindness and ultimately falls at the discretion of Wi-Fi Roomstaff. See <code>/rfaq WP transfer</code> for more information.</p>
