<span class="fw-bold">Want to understand how the Prize Shop works? You're in the right place!</span>
This page contains information about rules and guidelines of the Prizes section and outlines everything you need to know in order to make a purchase!
Be sure to read through the whole page carefully as it contains a lot of important information.

Wi-Fi Points (WP) are a type of currency we have in Wi-Fi that you can use to spend on valuable Pok&eacute;mon and items from our Prize Shop! WP is earned through participation in Small Events and Tournaments throughout the month. Build up your WP
count as high as you can and buy those rare prizes... or some Master Balls if you prefer!

    <ol>
      <li><span class="fw-bold">All sales are final</span>! You cannot refund a WP purchase once it has been delivered.</li><br />
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Pok&eacute;mon listed in the prize shop will not come with proof</span>. This means you cannot trade the Pok&eacute;mon that need proof in the room as they are intended to be rare and exclusive prizes.</li><br />
      <li><span class="fw-bold">Please allow up to two weeks for your order to be delivered</span>. We do try to deliver as promptly as we can! Bothering staff for your order will not expedite this process; please don't do that!</li><br />
