<p><span class="fw-bold">Congratulations and welcome, Room Voices!</span> This document will serve as a reference point for everything you need to know about your role as a Room Voice, from commands, to examples of things we like to see.</p>

    <span class="fw-bold">Important -</span> Avoid sharing this page outside of the #voices channel. We are aware that the repository for this site is public, but going out of your way to share this page to people who are not on the voices team will be considered leaking.

<h6 span class="fw-bold">Good practice of helpful commands!</h6>
<p>Your role as voice helps you to assist more users as you can now publicly broadcast information such as roomfaqs (rfaq commands). You can see a full list of Wi-Fi rfaqs by simply typing <code class="fw-bold">/rfaq</code> into the room. We love to see voices helping users where they can!</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid #ccc; background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: monospace; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 2px;">
    <h6 style="margin: 4px;" class="fw-bold">Example Scenario 1:</h6>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: How do I host a lottery giveaway?</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: !rfaq GA</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: Take a look through the information here, RandomUser123, and be sure to visit the Giveaway Rules.</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: Thank you for the help!</p>
</div>

<p>Providing the user with everything they need to know in a friendly and approachable manner is key. Try to keep responses as clear as possible and reference rfaqs and/or pages of the website where applicable.</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid #ccc; background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: monospace; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 2px;">
    <h6 style="margin: 4px;" class="fw-bold">Example Scenario 2:</h6>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #FF0000;">BadUser456</span> was banned from the Wi-Fi room by Billo. (Trading hacked Pokemon)</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: So what Pokemon/set did you guys use to beat the recent event raids? I need suggestions.</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: I used a Cosmog with 252 Atk 252 Speed and Splash for maximum damage output.</p>

<p>Hangman can be used to divert attention from a moderation action, when done sparingly; hangman spam can be disruptive to current room discussion. Instead, we recommend using a more naturally formed solution such as those provided in the above examples.</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid #ccc; background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: monospace; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 2px;">
    <h6 style="margin: 4px;" class="fw-bold">Example Scenario 3:</h6>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: I'm bored, what is there to do in this room?</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: !events</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: You can participate in any of the currently ongoing events and even get prizes for them!</p>
</div>

<p>It's always good to direct users looking for something to do to our events as that promotes them wanting to be a part of the room and gives them a fun experience at the same time.</p>
<hr />

<h6 span class="fw-bold">Hosting your own giveaways!</h6>
<p>First and foremost giveaways are always appreciated but by no means mandatory! They are a good way to accrue excitement in the room or redirect attention away from unwelcoming, such as after a moderation action. Giveaways can be as simple as a flawless Breedject or as far out as a flawless Shiny, your generosity has no limit! Remember as a voice, staff member approval for your Giveaway is not required, you can just get right into it! </p>

<p>Be sure to include the relevant proofing in the Extra Information of your Giveaway. (Only if your Pokemon needs proof to trade according to our <a href="https://pswifi.github.io/proof-guidelines/min-requirement/" target="_blank">Proof Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h6 span class="fw-bold">Helpfulness without commands!</h6>
<p>You don't always have to rely on using commands, using your knowledge of in-game mechanics to answer general questions a user may have is also a great thing to do! If you do not have an immediate answer but would like to help a user in the room, try referencing reliable sources like <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Bulbapedia</a> (for general game information) or <a href="https://www.pikalytics.com/" target="_blank">Pikalytics</a> (for competitive team building and strategies).</p>

    <h6 style="margin: 4px;" class="fw-bold">Example Scenario 4:</h6>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: Does anyone know where I can find the colored shards in PLA?</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: You can get them randomly from Space Time Distortions on the ground.</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: Oh perfect, thanks!</p>
</div>

<p>You do not always need to point people to internet sources if the answer is short and you are confident that the advice you are giving is correct.</p>

    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: Yawn, Flipturn, Stealthrock, Earthquake all seem to be Swamperts most used moves, <a href="https://www.pikalytics.com/pokedex/homebss/swampert" target="_blank">check here</a> for more info about other potential options.</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: Sweet, thanks!</p>
</div>

<p>Remember to give your links a caption/description, this is so the people reading the chat can have an idea of what is inside before clicking!</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid #ccc; background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: monospace; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 2px;">
    <h6 style="margin: 4px;" class="fw-bold">Example Scenario 6:</h6>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: Can anyone help me with a trade evo?</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #800080;">+ExceptionalVoice</span>: Sure, DM me!.</p>
    <p style="margin: 4px;"><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #1E90FF;">TypicalUser123</span>: Sweet, thanks!</p>
</div>

<p>Being helpful can also extend past answering questions such as helping with Trade Evolutions and the likes. This is extremely helpful to prevent the risk of scams, Voices and higher ranking are seen as the rooms trusted users.</p>
