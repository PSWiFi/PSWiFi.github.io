<hr />

<span class="fw-bold">Wondering what cloners do, or hoping to become an approved cloner?</span> This page contains information about cloning. The PS! Wi-Fi room permits the use of cloning for legitimate Pokémon. Cloning is the act of copy and pasting
already existing Pokémon data in order to have multiple copies. If done correctly, the Pokémon data will not be altered, thus remaining legitimate by our room standards.<br /> <br />

We facilitate cloning in all main series Pokémon games that are currently supported by official Nintendo Online services. <u>This includes all 3DS and Switch titles</u>.<br /><br />

<span class="fw-bold">Cloning methods that alter Pokémon data in any way is strictly banned and will render the Pokémon as not legitimate.</span><br /><br />

<h4><span class="fw-bold">Cloning Requirements:</span></h4>
<u>Approved Wi-Fi cloners must:</u>
<ol>
  <li>Have a solid grasp of room and proof rules.</li>
  <li>Use a cloning method that allows for quick and efficient hack checks.</li>
  <li>Be able to identify a hacked or illegal Pokémon reliably.</li>
  <li>Be an active and positive presence in the room for an extended period of time.</li>
</ol>

Room and proof rule knowledge and hack checking competency will be tested before you are approved for cloning! This is an open-book test so you will be able to refer to any information you need while the test is ongoing.<br /><br />
