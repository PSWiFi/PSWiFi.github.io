<span class="fw-bold">Wondering what cloners do, or hoping to become an approved cloner?</span> This page contains information about cloning. The PS! Wi-Fi room permits the use of cloning for legitimate Pokémon. Cloning is the act of copy/pasting
already existing Pokémon data in order to have multiple copies. If done correctly the Pokémon data will not be altered, this remaining legitimate by our room standards.<br /> <br />

We facilitate cloning in all main series Pokémon games that are currently supported by official Nintendo Online services. <u>This includes all 3DS and Switch titles.</u><br /><br />

<ol>
  <li>Have a good general knowledge of room and proof rules.</li>
  <li>Use a cloning method that allows for quick/efficient hack checks.</li>
  <li>Be able to identify a hacked or illegal Pokémon to a good extent </li>
