For example, if you hosted a raid and others caught the Pok&eacute;mon and traded them to you they are NOT self-obtained as they belong to the person who caught the Pok&eacute;mon. Likewise, eggs are only treated as self-obtained if you bred and hatched the egg yourself, if you received the egg through a Link Trade it is NOT self-obtained.

Every trainer has a fixed 4-digit TSV (Trainer Shiny Value), and every egg has a randomly generated 4-digit ESV (Egg Shiny Value). If a trainer's TSV matches an egg's ESV, the egg will hatch shiny. More modern games have removed this functionality entirely.

                    This is a code used for trading, battling, and joining raids/union circles in Switch titles. When attempting to communicate with another player you should make sure that you are using the correct Link Code and have made the other player aware of your IGN for smooth communication. If the code you are using is common (e.g 11111111) and you are unable to match with the correct player, consider using a less common code (e.g 32988397).
