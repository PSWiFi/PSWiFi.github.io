                    used to counter the games' usual RNG, which creates "random" outcomes. All RNG abused Pok&eacute;mon are obtainable through normal gameplay, but many of them are exceedingly rare. They are considered legitimate and legal.

                    If you say a Pok&eacute;mon is self-obtained, it means that you caught it, bred it, or redeemed it. If you trade the Pok&eacute;mon away, the new owner cannot say it was self-obtained since they were not the original person who obtained it.
                    This applies
                    similarly to Raids &mdash; if you did not catch that Pok&eacute;mon, it is not self-obtained. This is also the case for Pok&eacute;mon caught from raids from participants that are not the host. You don't own all the Pok&eacute;mon caught from
                    a Raid just because you
                    hosted it. Eggs in gen 8 are only treated as self-obtained if you bred the egg &mdash; if you received the egg in a link trade it is not deemed self-obtained.

                    method is often used for EV training. SOS-chaining with Chanseys in USUM is used to earn experience.

                    where a user collects many eggs, has their ESVs checked, and then uses a database to hunt for matching trainers to hatch their eggs shiny.

                    A unique 12-digit code generated once a player logs into Nintendo Wi-Fi Connections on their 3DS system. Find your Friend Code by going to your 3DS home screen and clicking on the orange smiley icon. Scroll over to your friend card and your
                    friend code will be listed on the top screen. You must exchange and add another person's FC to trade with them online. In Gen 8, you no longer need to exchange friend codes to trade.
