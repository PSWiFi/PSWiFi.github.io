    <td>Describes the Dynamax Adventure feature introduced with the Crown Tundra DLC update for Pokémon Sword and Shield and can also be used to describe Pokémon obtained from it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="fw-bold">Hacked</span></td>
    <td>Describes a Pokémon that was edited or created through external devices and programs. Hacked Pokémon can be legal, but this does not make them legitimate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="fw-bold">Streamer Pokémon</span></td>
    <td>Describes a Pokémon that has been given away on stream. These Pokémon are are all treated as if they could be hacked and cannot be traded in the PS! Wi-Fi room.</td>

      similarly to Raids &mdash; if you did not catch that Pokémon, it is not self-obtained. This is also the case for Pokémon caught from raids from participants that are not the host. You don't own all the Pokémon caught from a Raid just because you
      hosted it. Eggs in gen 8 are only treated as self-obtained if you bred the egg &mdash; if you received the egg in a link trade it is not deemed self-obtained.</td>

      where a user collects many eggs, has their ESVs checked, and then uses a database to hunt for matching trainers to hatch their eggs shiny.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><span class="fw-bold">Wonder Card</span></td>
