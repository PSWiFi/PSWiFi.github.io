</div><hr />

<p>This page contains everything a global staff member needs to moderate the Wi-Fi room, almost entirely using <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaqs</code>! Rules for room etiquette, trading & giveaways can be found in the navigation bar at the top of this page.</p>

  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #08265e;" id="common-topics"><span class="fw-bold">Common Banned Topics</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Here are some common topics that go against the room rules:</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Genning, hacking or glitch discussion:</span></h6>
    <p>These topics are strictly forbidden, and any discussion should be cleared from the room as soon as possible. This also includes old glitches that allow the obtainment of illegal Pokémon (such as the Mew glitch in gen 1 or "tweaking/void glitching" in gen 4).</p>
    
    <p>Also be on the lookout for trade offers that involve unreleased or clearly hacked Pokémon, for example if a user was offering a Shiny Hoopa. A list of shiny locked Pokémon can be found on <a href="https://www.serebii.net/games/shiny.shtml">Serebii</a>.</p>
    
    <p>If a user is seeking advice about if a Pokémon they own is hacked, please redirect them to a member of <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq isthishacked</code> or redirect them to a member of <code span class="fw-bold">/roomstaff</code>.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">AltWFC/Pretendo (unofficial online servers):</span></h6>
    <p>These topics are usually brought up with someone attempting to trade on a game/console that no longer has an active online service, posts such as "Anyone wants to trade in gen 4 / 5?" are an example of this. Trading using these servers is not allowed and users can be referred to <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq altwfc</code>.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Piracy, emulation and rom hacks:</span></h6>
    <p>Any mention or allusion to these topics are strictly banned. Users can be directed to <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq piracy</code> and the offending lines should be cleared from chat. Examples of emulators include VBA, MGBA, Bizhawk, Desmume, Citra, Yuzu, Ryujinx.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Passive mentions of each of these topics is allowed, examples include "I RNG manipulated xyz Pokémon today" or "I had this Pokémon cloned by a room cloner".</p>

    <p>For users wanting to learn how to RNG manipulate or clone Pokémon, please redirect them to the Wi-Fi Labs discord server found under <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq discord</code>. If they cite needing a new invite link or are interested in taking a cloning test, redirect them to a member of <code span class="fw-bold">/roomstaff</code>.</p>

    <p>Do not tolerate users being argumentative about cloning policies, users can be punished for this as though they have broken any other room rule or policy.</p>

  <div class="card-header text-light" style="background-color: #08265e;" id="in-game-communications"><span class="fw-bold">In-game Communications</span>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body card-bg">
    <p>Users should organize their trades in DMs after having posted a trade offer. Any further discussion in the main chat should be stopped to reduce unnecessary clutter. Any kind of code posted in chat for trades, battles or Union Circles must be cleared for the same reason.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Trade & battle requests:</span></h6>
    <p>Trade offers and battle requests should be posted only once per page or every 20 lines and should fit in one message. <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq trading</code> contains an example of how a trade post should look.</p>

    <p>Users posting their requests too often can be directed to <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq patience</code> and asked to post less frequently.</p>
      
    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Giveaway Information:</span></h6>
    <p>Users asking for, or distributing free Pokémon in trade posts should be told to avoid doing so. Information about giveaway rules and hosting giveaways can be found under <code span class="fw-bold">/rfaq ga</code>.</p>

    <h6><span class="fw-bold">Hosting Giveaways:</span></h6>
    <p>Giveaways are hosted via staff approval of forms filled by users. When a user submits a giveaway, a button only staff can see will appear in chat. If you are unfamiliar with game mechanics or our proofing rules and standards, you can just ignore the giveaways submitted and point them to the first room staff who comes online.</p>

    <p>If you want to start hosting giveaways, we recommend looking over our giveaway rules. Before starting a giveaway, please check if the user is autoconfirmed and if they have an active giveaway ban (which are usually a week long) in their punishlog.</p>

    <p>If the giveaway host informs you that the winner has failed to receive their prize, use the command <code span class="fw-bold">/giveaway ban [user], [reason]</code>. Some common reasons are "User did not receive the prize after 10 minutes," or "User can't receive the prize due to not having NSO.” Please, make sure at least 10 minutes have passed to giveaway ban a user for inactivity.</p>
