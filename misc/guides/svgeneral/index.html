<span class="fw-bold">Scarlet & Violet are here! In this guide, you will find some commonly asked questions to get you started and guide you along your journey into the Paldea region!</span><br /> <br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">What is shiny-locked and what isn't?</span></h3>
 
<span class="fw-normal">The term ‘shiny-locked’ refers to the ability of a Pokémon to be shiny or not; some Pokémon, such as those listed below, cannot be shiny even if reset.</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Static encounters, such as Gimmighoul, Koraidon, and Miraidon. 
    <li>All in-game trades are shiny-locked.
    <li>All in-game gifts are shiny-locked.
    <li>The starter Pokémon are shiny-locked.
  </ul>
<br />
  
<h3><span class="fw-bold">What are the shiny odds?</span></h3>
 
<span class="fw-normal">Refer to the graph <a href="https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1593266100627709957?s=20&t=zuG9odGMdeIXbJZW5yUSkQ">made by Anubis</a>:</span>

<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">What is Terastalizing?</span></h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Terastalizing your Pokémon will add the Tera Type of your Pokémon, causing the following:
      <ul>
        <li>All moves of this type will receive a 1.5x STAB bonus.
            <ul>
              <li>If the move already receives a 1.5x STAB bonus, such as a Fire-type Pokémon Terastilizing as a Fire-type and using a Fire-type move, the bonus becomes 2.0x.</li>
            </ul>
      </ul>
    <li>All other typings of the Pokémon are removed, and the Pokémon becomes the specific Tera Type it transforms into.
    <li>Terastalizing lasts the entirety of a match, but you must restore your Tera Orb at a Pokémon Center after each use in order to Terastilize once more. 
    <li>Switching will not remove the effects of Terastalizing your Pokémon.
  </ul>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How do Tera Raids work?</span></h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Tera Raids operate on a 1&#9733; to 6&#9733; range, with 6&#9733; Raids only being available after fully completing the game.
    <li>The Pokémon in Tera Raids will have a greater amount of HP than a regular Pokémon, scaling higher with each star. 
    <li>You receive 1,000 LP for interacting with a Tera Raid Den, up to 1,800 LP for interacting with a 6&#9733; Raid Den.
    <li>Tera Raid Battles have a time limit. Failure to defeat the Pokémon in this time limit will result in being blown out of the den. However, you can attempt the Den again.
    <li>If you are KOed, the timer will go down and you are benched for a few seconds.
    <li>You can cheer for your teammates by raising their offensive stats, defensive stats, or healing.
    <li>Throughout the battle, the Pokémon will do a variety of things to halt your victory, such as removing its own ailments, or removing your stat boosts.
    <li>Tera Raid Dens will drop a number of items, most notably variants of Herba Mystica and EXP. Candies.
  </ul>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How does the Victory Road work?</span></h3>
   <ul>
    <li>The Victory Road is what you would expect as in former Pokémon games: fight all eight Gym Leaders, the Elite Four, and Champion.
      <ul>
        <li>To go in order of level from lowest to highest: Cortondo (Katy), Artazon (Brassius), Levincia (Iono), Cascarrafa (Kofu), Medali (Larry), Montenevera (Ryme), Alfornada (Tulip), Glaseado (Grusha)
      </ul>
  </ul>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How does the Path of Legends work?</span></h3>
   <ul>
    <li>On the Path of Legends, you will defeat powerful Pokémon known as Titans. You will defeat the Titan once, then it will become more powerful and you will fight alongside Arven to defeat it.
      <ul>
        <li>To go in order of level from lowest to highest: Stony Cliff (Klawf), Open Sky (Bombirdier), Lurking Steel Titan (Orthworm), Quaking Earth Titan (Great Tusk [Scarlet] / Iron Treads [Violet]), Fake Dragon Titan (Dondozo)
      </ul>
  </ul>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How does &#9733; Starfall Street &#9733; work?</span></h3>
   <ul>
    <li>During this path, you will travel different Star Bases. There, you will have to defeat 30 Pokémon within 10 minutes using the Let’s Go feature. Afterwards, you will be challenged by the boss. Each boss has a Revavroom which is the same type as their Base.
      <ul>
        <li>To go in order of level from lowest to highest: Segin Squad (Giacomo), Schedar Squad (Mela), Navi Squad (Atticus), Ruchbah Squad (Ortega), Caph Base Squad (Eri)
      </ul>
  </ul>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">What are Paradox Pokémon?</span></h3>
   <ul>
    <li>In Scarlet, Paradox Pokémon are versions of Pokémon brought from the past, while in Violet, Paradox Pokémon are versions of Pokémon brought from the future.
    <li>Paradox Pokémon share similarities to their base forms, but have massively improved stats, different types, and unique traits. 
  </ul>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Can I use Koraidon and Miraidon in battle?</span></h3>
<p>Yes. You need to have completed the game, and then you can go to Miraidon in your party and click A to have it change into its battling form.</p>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Which Pokémon are affected by Synchronize?</span></h3>
<p>Synchronize allows you to sync the nature of the Pokémon with the ability to the opposing wild Pokémon. It does not work on wild Pokémon in this game.</p>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How does breeding work in this game?</span></h3>
<p>In order to breed, you must enter a picnic. Once there, walk in circles or play with your Pokémon until the basket on the end of the table has an egg in it. The Pokémon in your party will determine which egg spawns, so it’s advised to only have the two Pokémon you’re trying to breed together in your party while picnicking to breed!</p>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How do sandwiches work?</span></h3>
<p>Sandwiches can be created by collecting various ingredients from the food shops around the region &mdash; Aquiesta Supermarket, Artisan Bakery, Deli Cioso, and Sure Cans! Combining specific recipes will result in buffs; most notably, Egg Power and Sparkling Power, which boost the odds to get Eggs and encounter shinies, respectively. Each sandwich will last for 30 minutes, and can be created by Picnicking with your Pokémon.</p>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">How do I trade and battle with others?</span></h3>
<p>Connect to the internet, and enter the Poké Portal. You can also join Tera Raid battles with friends here!</p>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Is Pokérus in the game?</span></h3>
<p>No!</p>
<br />

<h3><span class="fw-bold">Where is the IV Checker?</span></h3>
<p>After defeating the game, you will unlock the IV Checker by speaking with a nurse at a Pokémon Center. Once unlocked, you can view IVs in your box.</p>
