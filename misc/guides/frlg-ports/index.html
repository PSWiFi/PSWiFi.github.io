<hr />

<p><span class="fw-bold">Pok&eacute;mon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green</span> were released as standalone titles on the Nintendo Switch on February 27th, 2026. As these games differ significantly from the modern Pok&eacute;mon experience, this page provides helpful tips and tricks to enhance your overall gameplay experience and help you adjust to their mechanics.</p>

<hr />

<h4 span class="fw-bold">1. Shiny Pok&eacute;mon</h4>
<p>Shiny Pok&eacute;mon are much rarer in the older generations. In Generation 3 the odds are <span class="fw-bold">1 in 8,192</span>, and unlike later games where the rates of finding a Shiny Pok&eacute;mon are significantly increased. There are no ways to increase your shiny rates in these games, no chaining methods, no Shiny Charm, nothing. Every encounter has the same probability. On the bright side, shiny locks do not exist, hunt that Shiny Mewtwo!</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">2. Fairy Type</h4>
<p>The Fairy type did not exist until Generation 6, this means that the Generation 3 games do not include the Fairy type at all. Notably Cleffa, Clefairy, Clefable, Igglybuff, Jigglypuff, Wigglytuff, Mr. Mime, Togepi, Togetic, Marill, Azumarill, Snubbull, and Granbull retain their original typings and therefore do not have any Fairy-type weaknesses or resistances.</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">3. Exp. Share</h4>
<p>Unlike Generation 6 onward, the Exp. Share is not automatically applied in Generation 3. Instead, it is a held item obtained later in the game and its effect only applies to the Pok&eacute;mon holding it. If you want a Pok&eacute;mon to gain experience you better make sure it participates in battle or holds the Exp. Share!</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">4. Physical / Special Split</h4>
<p>From Generations 1-3, physical and special moves were decided by type, not related to the individual move itself. For example, all fighting-type moves are considered physical, and all fire-type moves are considered special. View the table below for a visual representation.</p>

<table class="table table-striped" style="width:100%; border: 1px solid #000; border-collapse: collapse;" id="physical-special-split">

<h4 span class="fw-bold">5. TMs, HMs &amp; Move Tutors</h4>
<p>TMs in Generation 3 can only be used once, and very few can be found more than once in a game. When you acquire a TM, think carefully about which Pok&eacute;mon should learn it. Chances are, you won't be getting another copy of it without an in-person trade.</p>

<p>HMs can be found throughout the game and taught to your Pok&eacute;mon as many times as you like. However, keep in mind that once a Pok&eacute;mon learns an HM, it cannot be forgotten normally. You'll need to visit the Move Deleter in Fuchsia City to remove it from their moveset. It's generaly a good idea to have a Pok&eacute;mon on your team who will know as many of these moves as possible to avoid having Pok&eacute;mon you commonly use lose useful move-slots.</p>

<p>Move tutors can be found throughout the game and will teach a Pok&eacute;mon moves which were TMs in Generation 1 or are otherwise unobtainable - these are also one use only. So like TMs, think carefully.</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">6. Move Reminder</h4>
<p>Unlike more recent games, relearning a move is quite a long process. You need a special NPC - the move reminder, who can't be accessed till near the end of the game. He will want two Tiny Mushrooms or a single Big Mushroom (often held by wild Paras and Parasect) per move he will help a Pok&eacute;mon relearn. These mushrooms are valuable in more ways than just money, do not sell them!</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">7. Strange Evolutions</h4>
<p>In Fire Red / Leaf Green Pok&eacute;mon will not evolve into later generation Pok&eacute;mon until the National Pok&eacute;dex is obtained. This involves beating the Elite 4 with 60 Pok&eacute;mon obtained, and then talking to Professor Oak.</p>

<p>The notable examples of Pok&eacute;mon that do not evolve until the post game are Golbat and Chansey - even if the required happiness is obtained, they will not evolve. They will try to, but you will be presented with an obscure "?" message on screen and the evolution will be prevented.</p>

<p>In addition, due to the lack of time-based mechanics, Eevee cannot evolve into Espeon and Umbreon at all.</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">8. The Legendary Beasts</h4>
<p>One of the Crowned Beasts (Suicune, Raikou, and Entei) are obtainable post game, and the one you get in your game decided is by whichever one is super-effective against your starter. They roam around like in Johto, however they have a pretty serious bug.</p>

<p>If you have Suicune you do not need to worry and can move on. Raikou and Entei however, will permanently despawn if they ever use Roar against you. This will generally only occur if you use Mean Look or an ability like Arena Trap. For this reason it is recommended to save your Master Ball for Raikou and Entei, or to save the game before setting out to hunt them.</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">9. The Rocket Game Corner</h4>
<p>The Game Corner (openly run by organised crime syndicate Team Rocket) has different prizes depending on version. While these are minor for the most part, such as slight price changes and some version exclusives, the are more significant differences like the price of Porygon. While Porygon only costs 6,500 Coins in LeafGreen, in FireRed it costs a whopping 9,999 coins!</p>

<p>That's an extra 35,000 Pok&eacute;dollars to buy all those coins. As there's not a lot of ways to make quick money in older games, you might want to consider the cost of Porygon when deciding on which version to get.</p>

<h4 span class="fw-bold">10. Poison Out-of-battle Effect</h4>
<p>In Generation 3 games, poison continues to cause damage outside of battle. Your Pok&eacute;mon will lose 1 HP per 4 steps taken in the overworld, so you can easily black out walking along a route as the HP of your Pok&eacute;mon ticks down. Hold onto those Antidotes, Pecha Berries, Full Heals and Full Restores!</p>
